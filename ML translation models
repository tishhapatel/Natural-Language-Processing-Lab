✅ Models Used in Machine Translation (Language Translation)
1) Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT)
✅ What it does:

Uses grammar rules + dictionary written by humans.

✅ Example:

English → Hindi
“I eat apples” → “मैं सेब खाता हूँ”

✅ Used when:

strict grammar-based translation needed

older systems

2) Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
✅ What it does:

Learns translation using probability/statistics from large bilingual datasets.

✅ Example:

It calculates probabilities like:

P(“सेब”) = “apple”

P(sentence translation) based on training data

✅ Types:

Phrase-based SMT (most common)

3) Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT)
✅ What it does:

Uses previous translation examples and matches similar patterns.

✅ Example:

If dataset has:
“I am a student” → “मैं एक छात्र हूँ”
Then for:
“I am a teacher” it predicts: “मैं एक शिक्षक हूँ”

4) Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
✅ What it does:

Uses Deep Learning Neural Networks to translate end-to-end.

Instead of translating word by word, it translates whole sentence meaning.

✅ Example:

English → French
“How are you?” → “Comment ça va ?”

✅ NMT gives more natural translations.

✅ Deep Learning Models in NMT (Most Important)
5) RNN-based Seq2Seq Model (Encoder–Decoder)
✅ What it does:

Encoder reads source sentence

Decoder generates translated sentence

✅ Example:

Input: “I love India”
Output: “मुझे भारत पसंद है”

📌 Problem: slow + difficulty with long sentences.

6) Seq2Seq with Attention
✅ What it improves:

Attention helps model focus on important words while translating.

✅ Example:

“The boy who is wearing a red shirt is running”
Attention helps model connect:

“boy” ↔ “लड़का”

“red shirt” ↔ “लाल शर्ट”

✅ Much better accuracy than plain Seq2Seq.

7) Transformer Model (Most Used Today ✅)
✅ What it does:

Uses Self-Attention and parallel processing, no RNN needed.

✅ Why best:

fast training

handles long sentences well

state-of-the-art MT results

✅ Example:

English → Spanish
“I will go to the market tomorrow.”
→ “Iré al mercado mañana.”

✅ Pretrained Translation Models (Real Life)

These are used in actual systems:

8) Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT)

Google Translate uses neural-based systems (Transformer/NMT based).

9) mBART

A multilingual translation model trained for many languages.

Example: English ↔ Hindi, English ↔ French, etc.

10) MarianMT

Open-source NMT models for translation (popular in research).

11) T5 / mT5

Text-to-text transformer models. Translation can be done like:
“translate English to Hindi: I love you”
→ “मैं तुमसे प्यार करता हूँ”

12) GPT-based Translation Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate too.

Example:
Translate: “Cybersecurity is important.”
→ “साइबर सुरक्षा महत्वपूर्ण है।”
