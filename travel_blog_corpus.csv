NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/capital-one-venture-x-business/,"
I’m a sucker for a good travel rewards card. Over the years, I’ve collected a small handful of them — not because I love juggling annual fees, but because the right cards can save you a lot of money on flights, hotels, and travel perks you’d otherwise pay out of pocket for. Not only do I have a bunch for my personal expenses but I have a couple for this business too. One of my favorite business credit cards is the Capital One Venture X Business Credit Card. It’s Capital One’s top-tier business product. I love it because there’s a big welcome offer, lounge access to over 1,300 airport lounges, annual travel credits, and a simple 2x reward on all spending (which ensures you are always earning multiples miles per dollar spent). To help you decide if this card is for you, here’s my full review of the card and why I love it so much: Table of ContentsWhat is the Capital One Venture X Business Card?Using Your Capital One MilesPros of the Venture X Business CardShould You Get This Card?

  Table of Contents The Capital One Venture X Business Credit Card is a travel rewards card issued by Capital One. It comes with a $395 annual fee that is way lower than the other premium business cards out there. And I think you can easily get way more value than the annual fee costs. Here’s a quick look at the main perks:   Capital One miles can be redeemed in a few ways. One is by booking travel directly through Capital One’s portal. While I usually don’t recommend booking through credit card portals, to fully benefit from the Venture X’s travel credit (and to get the 5x and 10x miles offers) you’ll need to use their portal. Another option is to use your miles to get reimbursed for any travel purchase. For 90 days after making such a purchase, you can reimburse yourself at a redemption rate of one cent per mile. After 90 days, and for all other purchases, you can use miles as cash back, at a redemption rate of 0.5 cents per mile (but avoid doing this, as it’s not a good value). You can also use your Capital One miles in the Capital One Entertainment portal to book tickets for concerts, sports events, and more. Occasionally, Capital One offers cardholder-only events and presale opportunities too. While you’ll get just 0.8 cents per mile for tickets (not the best value), it’s still a fun and unique way to redeem miles. However, you’ll get the most out of your miles by transferring them to Capital One’s 15+ airline and hotel partners. While the actual value varies based on what you book, you can usually find airline and hotel redemptions worth much more than the aforementioned one cent per mile. (The process is pretty straightforward and can be done through your Capital One account.) Here are Capital One’s current travel partners:   As someone who travels constantly for work, I’m always looking for ways to earn miles faster and make airport life a little less painful. I like this card for the simple 2x miles on everything. I use a lot of other cards that can get you 3 or 4x on certain categories like advertising or non-portal travel spend like flights and hotels. But when it comes to dining, museums, transportation, etc, there’s not a lot of ways to get more than 2x per dollar spent on a business card. So, I use this Venture X for anything I can’t get more than 2x per dollar.  Here’s a deep dive into some of the main perks: $300 Travel Credit
Each year, you get a $300 credit toward bookings made through Capital One Business Travel (flights, hotels, or car rentals). If you’re already booking travel regularly, this credit is basically free money — and it immediately drops your effective annual fee from $395 to $95. The catch? You do have to book through Capital One’s travel portal. It’s powered by Hopper, so the interface is clean and prices are usually competitive. I’ve found some good deals there.  Lounge Access
You get access to Capital One Lounges and Priority Pass lounges. Capital One’s own lounges are actually great — spacious, modern, good food — though they’re still limited location. But they are expanding how many they have and I personally think they are way better than the other lounges competitor banks have. You also get Priority Pass access t o over 1,300 lounges globally, which is a common but really nice perk. Anniversary Bonus
Every year on your account anniversary, you’ll get 10,000 bonus miles (worth about $100 toward travel). It’s a nice “thank you” that helps offset the annual fee even further.
  The Capital One Venture X Business Credit Card is best for small- to medium-sized business owners who travel regularly and can put at least $30,000 to ensure they meet the welcome offer requirements.  Overall, I think the Capital One Venture X Business is one of the best-value premium business cards out there right now. It’s not as benefit-packed or as flashy as the The Business Platinum Card® from American Express or the Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business?, but it’s easier to use, has a less expensive annual fee, gets you lounge access, and an easy to understand earning structure.  It’s one of the cards I use the most often for my business. I highly recommend getting it. Download my free guide to points and miles and learn how to use points and miles for free travel!

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-privilege/," Let’s face it: not everyone is going to be able to travel. Whether it’s money, family obligations, or circumstance, travel is out of reach for a large percentage of the world’s population. In the “quit your job to travel the world” cheerleading that happens so often on travel websites (including this one), we often forget that it’s not so easy for everyone. Yes, years on the road have shown me that, for many of us, our inability to travel is partly a mindset issue (since we believe travel is expensive, we don’t look for ways to make it cheaper) and partly a spending issue (we spend money on things we don’t need). Our culture says travel is expensive and — without a frame of reference to know that that is wrong — people just assume it’s right. And yes, people who have decent-paying jobs but go shopping often or spend a lot on avocado toast (or whatever it is they spend money on) are more often than not prioritizing travel. But there are those for whom no mindset change, spending cuts, or budget tips will help them travel — those who are too sick, have parents or children to care for, face great debt, or work three jobs just to pay their rent. After all, 2.8 billion people — nearly 40% of the world’s population — survive on less than $2 USD a day! In my home country of the United States, 14% of the population is below the poverty line, 46 million people are on food stamps, many have to work two jobs to get by, and we have a trillion dollars in student debt dragging people down. No tips on any website will magically make travel a reality for those people. Those of us who do travel are a privileged few. Whether we quit our jobs to travel the world, spend two months in Europe, or take our kids on a short vacation to Disney World, we get to experience something most people in the world will never get a chance to do. We overlook that fact too often. We overlook how lucky we are. I grew up in a predominately white, middle-class town with parents who paid my college tuition. I had a job after college that allowed me to live on my own, take vacations, and still save for my first trip around the world. And because I speak English, I easily found work teaching English in Thailand, where I could save to extend my travels. That’s not to say that hard work doesn’t count. But hard work doesn’t exist in a bubble, and the circumstances that create the opportunities for hard work to bear fruit are often more important. I’ve met people of all ages, incomes, abilities, and nationalities on the road. Folks like Don and Alison, who are backpacking the world at 70; Michael, who worked 60-hour weeks at a minimum-wage job; Cory, who travels the world in a wheelchair; Ishwinder, who didn’t let visa restrictions stop him; and countless others. But even they had circumstances that allowed them to travel: support from family and friends, jobs that allowed for overtime, or other skills. They weren’t barely getting by or on social assistance. They didn’t wonder if they could afford their next meal. I worked hard to get where I am. I’m sure you’ve worked hard too. One’s work isn’t less because of opportunity. But I think it’s important to remember that the circumstances around you make it easier for your work to bear fruit than for others. It’s easier to succeed when you don’t have to worry about housing or your next meal. It’s easier to succeed if you’re educated or can get a full night’s sleep in a safe community. We are some of the lucky ones. We get to do something that others will never be able to do. We are privileged. Even if you’ve hitchhiked around the world with no money, worked overseas, cut costs to travel around the world on $10 USD a day, or used points and miles to get a first-class ticket, you have the opportunity to do something most people go to sleep only dreaming about. You have the freedom and choice to move about the world in a way most people don’t. That’s a form of privilege. As we go into this new year, I think it’s important that we never forget or be ungrateful for the opportunity we have. Let’s not take it for granted. Let’s be humble. Let’s be more respectful. Let’s give back. And let’s not squander the opportunity.

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-airbnb-experiences-tokyo/,"Tokyo is one of those cities that feels endlessly deep. You can visit a dozen times and still discover new food stalls, hidden shrines, late-night bars, quirky subcultures, and neighborhoods that feel like completely different worlds. (I know because I’ve visited about 10 times already!) One of my favorite ways to explore Tokyo is by taking an Airbnb Experience. Led by locals and long-term residents, these tours give you a front-row seat to Tokyo’s food culture, nightlife, history, and crafts in a way you rarely get when wandering on your own. I’ve done a lot of Airbnb Experiences in Tokyo over the years and think they are often even better than traditional tours you find on Get Your Guide (though Arigato Travel is next level and the best traditional tour company in the city so don’t miss out on them). To help you pick from the endless Experiences you can find, below are my favorite in Tokyo that combine cultural immersion, hands-on learning, and just the right amount of fun: Sushi-making classes are common in Tokyo but this Airbnb Experience stands out because it’s done in an omakase restaurant. This class is given by a sushi master (or his apprentice). You don’t just learn how to shape rice or slice fish; you learn why certain cuts matter, how chefs season rice differently depending on style, and how to pair ingredients to highlight texture and flavor. The class is hands-on and surprisingly approachable. It’s a small group experience done in the morning so you can have a filling and fun breakfast experience before going out to explore Tokyo. I absolutely loved it. Book here! This is my favorite nightlife tour in Tokyo. The host, Suemi, and her friends provide the absolute best time. This Shibuya nightlife tour one takes you to 3-4 izakaya spots that are very untouristy and filled without locals. You get unlimited food and drinks and it’s a really great experience. My guide, Shugo, was outgoing, spoke conversational English, handled large group dynamics well, was entertaining, explained the culture of izakaya restaurants in detail, and stayed past when the Experienced ended. He was great! Additionally, Suemi and her friends also run an unlimited Sake tasting class, which is the best Sake class I’ve done in Tokyo. They go into incredible detail about how sake is made and use a lot of visuals so it’s really easy to understand. It’s a small group of six, which made the Experience really personable. If you take a Sake experience, take this one. (They also un a whiskey tasting experience that I haven’t done this one yet but I bet it’s just as good). Book here! This experience is similar in spirit to the Shibuya nightlife tour but set in one of Tokyo’s other major nightlife hubs. Shinjuku is packed with tiny izakaya spots, many of them hidden in narrow alleyways or upstairs spaces you’d never think to enter on your own. On this tour, Yuma (a knowledgeable sake sommelier) takes you to several of these small, local spots and walks you through how izakaya culture really works. You’ll try different styles of sake along the way and learn how to read menus, what to order, and how locals typically drink and eat in these settings. Yuma is outgoing, fun, and very good at explaining things clearly without overwhelming you. It’s social, relaxed, and a great way to experience Shinjuku nightlife without feeling lost or intimidated. Book here! This is one of the most educational experiences I’ve done in Tokyo. Instead of focusing on the usual tourist areas, this tour explores quieter neighborhoods that retain a strong connection to the city’s past. The host is a lecturer specializing in Japanese history and traditional culture, and it really shows in the depth of information shared throughout the walk. You’ll visit places like Nezu Shrine, walk through its tunnel of red torii gates, explore the old streets of Yanaka, and learn about the Edo period, the Meiji Restoration, and how the role of the samurai changed as Japan modernized. It’s a 2.5-hour walk that never feels rushed and gives you a much clearer understanding of how Tokyo became the city it is today. I learned a lot from this tour. Book here! Tokyo has an burgeoning coffee scene and this tour does a great job of showing it to you. You explore Jimbocho and Kanda, two very under visited neighborhoods, to learn about both old-school kissaten and modern specialty cafés. You’ll learn about brewing techniques, flavor profiles, and how Japan developed such a meticulous approach to coffee. The tour includes visits to historic cafés, specialty shops leading Tokyo’s third-wave movement, and even wagashi shops where you’ll learn how traditional Japanese sweets pair with coffee. It’s a really thoughtful and unique afternoon experience. Book here! This one-hour experience is a great introduction to matcha and Japanese tea culture. You’ll learn about the history of matcha, its role in Japanese society, and how to tell high-quality matcha from lower-grade varieties. The host walks you through the traditional preparation process step by step. You’ll whisk and taste authentic matcha in a calm, traditional setting that feels worlds away from Tokyo’s busy streets. It’s short but memorable, and it gives you a much deeper appreciation for something you’ll see everywhere while traveling in Japan. Book here! Ramen is synonymous with Japanese food, and this tour helps you understand why it inspires such devotion. Over the course of about three hours, you’ll visit multiple ramen shops, each highlighting a different style or approach.
You’ll learn about ramen’s origins, modern trends, and regional variations while tasting everything from classic bowls to more experimental or fusion styles. The guide explains broth types, noodle textures, and toppings in a way that’s easy to follow. Come hungry as this tour will absolutely fill you up! Book here! This tour takes you through Shibuya and Harajuku to see murals and installations hidden in alleyways and less obvious spaces. Street art is a much quieter, more underground scene in Tokyo (they Japanese aren’t so keen on murals on their buildings) so learning about where it is allowed and how the culture thrives in such a restrictive environment is really interesting. he tour also includes visual examples of murals before and after they were created, which adds helpful context. I think it is one of the most interesting and unique Airbnb Experiences and gives you a really good look at a side of Japan most people don’t see! Book here!
  ***
There’s a lot of Airbnb Experiences in Tokyo and I know I’m probably I’m missing some really great ones (After all, I’m only one person) but these eight will give you a good start. Try to do at least one when you’re in Tokyo because most conventional organized tours are all cookie cutter experiences. These Airbnb tours are way more fun! Book Your Flight

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/holafly-esims/,"
When you’re traveling, staying connected is essential. Whether you’re figuring out the best route to your hostel, finding a place to eat, or translating a train schedule or menu, having reliable data makes life on the road infinitely easier. I still remember my early days of travel carrying a physical guidebook around as I wandered the streets looking for my accommodation. Or, when smartphones became widespread, searching for a SIM card kiosk to buy a physical SIM, trying to poorly communicate with staff in a language I didn’t know, and spending 20 minutes swapping out tiny plastic chips. Luckily, things have changed and life is incredibly easier thanks to eSIMs. Rather than needing a physical SIM card, you can download an app that gives you tons of high-speed data. In a world where we need to be connected for so many reasons (for example, everything in China is paid through an app, so you need data), eSIMs are great. One company that’s become a major player in this space is Holafly. (Use the code MATTK to get a 5% discount.) They offer unlimited data, quick setup, and global coverage without the hassle of finding a physical SIM card. In a world of seemingly never ending eSIM companies, they are one of the best. In this blog post, I will tell you why! 
Holafly is a Spanish-founded company that started back in 2017 and is now based in Dublin. They offer eSIMs that you can install on your phone via QR code. Once activated, they let you connect to the internet abroad using local carrier networks. What sets Holafly apart from a lot of other providers is that over 200 of their options come with unlimited data and are priced by days rather than gigabytes. You can personalize the days from 1 up to 90 days in over 200 destinations. Holafly’s coverage is also pretty extensive. They offer service in over 200 destinations, which includes most of Europe, Asia, North America, and Latin America. The process of setting up Holafly is incredibly straightforward. Here is how to do it:  Check your phone first – Make sure your device is unlocked and supports eSIM (most recent iPhones and many newer Androids do). Have a Wi-Fi connection handy for setup.  Save the email & QR – Keep the QR code and order info somewhere safe.  Install the eSIM – While on Wi-Fi, open the confirmation email and scan the QR code from your phone camera or tap the activation link. There are three options: On iPhone: Settings -> Cellular (or Mobile Data) -> Add Cellular Plan -> scan the QR.  On Android: Settings -> Network & internet (or Connections) -> SIMs or Mobile network -> Add eSIM / Add mobile plan -> scan the QR. (Exact labels vary by phone.) On arrival, enable data roaming for the eSIM – Go to Cellular/Mobile Data settings, select the Holafly line and turn on Data Roaming and Mobile Data for that line. (Turn off Mobile Data for your home SIM to avoid accidental roaming charges.) Holafly partners with local carriers, so your connection depends on whichever network is strongest in that region. Note that Holafly’s eSIMs are data-only. You can keep your home SIM card in your phone for texts or calls, while Holafly handles all your data. Apps like WhatsApp, iMessage, and Telegram will still work with your regular number, so you can message friends and family just like you would at home. The “unlimited data” promise is what draws most people in, and for good reason. Most eSIM companies sell data in small bundles, which adds up quickly, especially if you’re using maps, social media, or video calls. With Holafly, you just pay for the number of days you need and get unlimited data during that time. Plans start at around $4 USD per day, though they are cheaper if you get more days or choose their new subscription options Holafly Plans. Plus, Holafly offers 24/7 customer support multilingual, hotspot capabilities, 15+ regional eSIMs, a global eSIM, no hidden costs, and an incredible 6 month flexible refund policy. I think it’s one of the best eSIM options for travelers who want reliability and ease of use. It’s especially great for people visiting multiple countries or anyone who relies heavily on mobile data — bloggers, remote workers, or digital nomads. The connection has been consistent, speeds are good, and the ability to set everything up before I even leave home is a huge time-saver At the end of the day, that’s really what makes Holafly appealing: simplicity. You don’t have to think about data, SIM cards, or network compatibility. You just scan, activate, and go. For travelers like me, that convenience is priceless. Use the code MATTK to get a 5% discount on any eSIM for your next adventure! Terms and Conditions:

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/the-ultimate-guide-to-traveling-when-you-have-no-money/," Whenever I ask readers what the number one thing holding them back from traveling is, I almost always get the same answer: money. This problem — and how to overcome it — is my most asked question. “Matt, I don’t know how to afford travel. Help!” I have answered this question in a plethora of posts, emails, tweets, and Facebook posts. Long-term readers might even be getting sick of me discussing this subject because it is one I talk about so much. But I know no matter how often I address this question, it will come up again. Since this question comes up so often, I like to constantly remind people of this fact: You do not need to be rich to travel. There are plenty of ways to travel on a budget (and for free) — you just need to be willing to get creative. Traveling the world with little or no money sounds like an impossible dream. But it is possible. It’s not glamorous, but it’s possible. It should be said that there are some expenses you shouldn’t compromise on (like travel insurance) but there are tons of ways you can travel the world on a budget — including plenty of ways you can actually travel for free. In this post, I’m going to show you two things: With the right budget and the right mindset, you can make your travel dreams a reality. Even if you don’t earn a lot or you have debt, there are still plenty of ways to go overseas (I still had debt when I went on my first trip around the world). They may not be fancy or luxurious, but if travel is your priority then you can definitely make it happen! Ready to kick-start your budget travels and save money? Just click on either of the links below to jump directly to that section! Table of Contents Not making enough money at your job? Working at a job you hate? Why not get a job overseas? There are plenty of opportunities in the world as long as you aren’t picky. After all, this isn’t a career you are starting — it’s just a way to earn money for travel. Here are some popular (and easy to find) jobs you can get when you travel: Working overseas often gets discounted as an option because it seems hard to do. It’s not. Just be open. These jobs don’t require advanced degrees or a lot of work experience either. Are you going to get a high-paying office job? No. Will you get a shitty, low-wage job that will pay all your travel bills? Yep! I’ve met people from all walks of life, both from Western and non-Western countries, funding their travels this way. It’s an easy, fun way to lengthen your travels, deepen your experience, and make a little money so you can keep on traveling.

One of the best ways to make money for travel is to teach English overseas. You can make a lot of money teaching —I replenished my travel funds while teaching in Thailand, and I have had friends leave South Korea with tens of thousands of dollars in the bank. All you need is the ability to speak English fluently and a TEFL degree, depending on the country you work in. If you have a college or university degree, you’ll be able to make more money and apply for better positions though it’s not necessary for many countries. Additionally, there are many websites and services out there that allow you to teach virtually. As long as you have a great Wi-Fi connection, you can help people learn English from anywhere in the world! Italki is one of the most popular online platforms. READ MORE ABOUT TEACHING OVERSEAS: WWOOF stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. It’s a platform that allows you to work on a farm in exchange for free room and board. It’s a great way to see a destination in-depth while allowing you to commune with the great outdoors. You have to pay to get to the farm, but once you are there, everything else is covered! It definitely will help you travel cheap as well as have a unique experience and meet lots of cool people. WWOOF has opportunities available in 130 countries around the world, with over 12,000 hosts and 100,000 WWOOFers. Some of the most popular destinations for WWOOFers are Portugal, France, Italy, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. This post can give the complete low down on how to travel and work around the world with WWOOF.   
Use the sharing economy to find cheaper accommodation, quirky tour guides, rideshare options, and home-cooked meals with local chefs. You can bypass the traditional travel industry with sharing economy websites and gain access to locals using their own assets and skills to become small tourism companies with cheaper prices. Moreover, locals know where to find deals. They know which supermarket is cheapest, which stores offer the best sales, and where to find the hole-in-the-wall restaurants and bars with the tastiest food at the lowest prices. Talking directly to them gives you access to that knowledge. Here are some of my favorite websites: The best way to save money on the road is to cook all your own meals. While in Stockholm, I spent $60 USD for a week’s worth of groceries instead of an average of $15 USD per meal eating out! That’s a savings of $150 USD! I’ve done the same thing in dozens of countries all around the world — especially in expensive destinations like Iceland where eating out can really destroy your budget. If you are staying in hostels, book accommodation that has a kitchen so you have space to cook. If you’re Couchsurfing or using Airbnb, your host will probably have a kitchen. No kitchen? Pack your own container and cutlery and make some sandwiches and salads on the go. Not every meal requires a stove, right? Just because you are traveling doesn’t mean you need to eat out every meal. You won’t ruin your trip to Paris if you decide not to eat out one day! There’s simply no reason to be spending lots of money on food on your trip!

Rail passes (like the Eurail Pass in Europe or the JR Pass in Japan) are a great way to save money when it comes to train travel. If you’re traveling around the region for a while, rail passes will likely be much cheaper than just booking individual trips. If you are booking individual trips, booking ahead of time can usually save you about 50% of the cost of a train ticket. However, that fixes you to a set timeline. If you don’t want to be tied into a fixed schedule, rail passes can save you a lot of money while giving you the flexibility you need. I’ve saved hundreds of dollars in Europe doing this! READ MORE ABOUT RAIL PASSES: Large hostel dorm rooms are the cheapest paid accommodation out there. The bigger the dorm, the cheaper it will be. While a 4-6 bed dorm might give you more privacy, a 12-18 bed dorm is going to be a bit cheaper. In the long run, this will add up. As long as you’ve got earplugs and a sleeping mask, opt for the bigger dorm to keep your budget intact! In a large dorm, you’re almost guaranteed to have some snorers. If earplugs don’t quite do the trick, download an app like Rain Rain, which plays rain sounds on a loop. You can set a timer so they stop playing after an hour or two, helping you ignore the noises of the dorm while you try to fall asleep. Spotify also has all kinds of rain and white noise playlists too. For discounts on hostels in Europe, check out HostelPass. This card gives you up to 20% off hostels throughout Europe. They’re constantly adding new hostels too. I’ve always wanted something like this and am glad it finally exists! (Use code NOMADICMATT for 25% off your membership.)

Enter your info below to get the guide sent to you right away: Are you a student, teacher, or under 26? Welcome to the world of 50%-off attractions and a plethora of discounts! Get a student/teacher/youth card and save big while you’re abroad. Even if you’ve recently graduated, chances are you can still get by with your expired ID card (as long as it doesn’t have an expiry date). Always ask if there are discounts available for students or youth as this is an easy way to save tons of cash as you travel around! Museums, galleries, and other major tourist attractions usually have discounts (especially in Europe). It never hurts to ask! (There are also often discounts for senior travelers and veterans as well, so always ask!) If you plan on seeing a lot of sights in a city, you should get a city tourism card. These will offer you discounted and/or free access to the major attractions and museums, as well as free public transportation. I saved over $100 USD with the London pass, $80 USD with the Paris Museum card, $50 USD with a Helsinki card, and tons more with other city tourism cards. They are an amazing way to save money on attractions that not enough people use. Just head to the local tourism office to find out what cards are available. They can help answer all your questions and make sure you save as much money as possible. Not every city has them, but most major destinations do and you’ll save a lot of money if you plan on seeing the major sights. Need some cash? Use Craigslist (operates in 70 countries), TaskRabbit (mainly in the US and Canada, though also in Italy and Spain), or Gumtree (UK-based) to find paid odd jobs, like assisting people who need a few things done around the house. It’s a way to make money when you travel without committing to a long-term job. Additionally, if you have a skill, sell it. Offer haircuts to other travelers, busk for money, provide online services like editing, graphic design, or consulting. It’s never been easier to work online. As long as you have Wi-Fi you can make money. The sky is the limit here — get creative! 
Collecting points and miles is the #1 way I’ve been able to afford so many flights and hotels over the years. By using a travel credit card for regular spending on groceries, restaurants, and shopping, I’ve been able to earn free flights and hotel stays — all by spending money I was going to spend anyway! These days, there are tons of ways to earn free flights. Simply sign up for a few travel credit cards, collect miles, and then fly for free. Most cards offer sign-up bonuses of 50,000 points (or more) — which is often enough for a free round-trip flight right there. And if you sign up for both an airline card (e.g., a United credit card) and a general rewards card, you can combine the two point balances and get a cheap flight faster. There’s even a card now — The Bilt Mastercard®– that lets you earn points on your rent! Collecting points and miles isn’t only for Americans either (though US residents have the best options). Canadians can collect points too, as can folks from Australia and New Zealand and the UK. READ MORE ABOUT POINTS & MILES: There are many services that connect travelers with locals who are willing to let them stay with them for free. Using these sites, you will never have to pay for accommodation. I’ve used this service dozens of times over the years and always meet amazing people. Sometimes you get a room, sometimes a couch, sometimes an air mattress, but it’s always free. These websites not only save you a TON of money but also get you off the tourist track and into the local life. Win-win! Here is a list of websites to use for free accommodation: 
Hitchhiking is a free way to get around that is relatively safe and quite common in many parts of the world, including Central America, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. I’ve hitchhiked in a handful of countries (and I know solo female travelers who have done the same!). Sure, it has a bad reputation in North America, but with some common sense and a bit of patience, you can hitchhike almost anywhere — saving you tons of money in the process! Here are a few basic tips to help you get started: READ MORE ABOUT HITCHHIKING: Want to learn about the city, get your bearings, and see the major sights? Take a free walking tour. You can find them in most major cities — just ask the local tourist office, your hostel staff, or Google “free walking tour (city name).” You’ll get a solid introduction to the city while also getting access to a local guide you can ask questions to. I always start my visits to a new city with one. Just be sure to tip your guide at the end (that’s how they get paid). This page has a list of all my favorite walking tours around the world broken down by city.
  
If you’re on a tight budget, you can pet and house sit for fellow travel lovers when they go on their own vacations! In exchange, you’ll get free accommodation while you’re watching their home and pets (animal care is involved 99% of the time). You can sign up for one of the sites below to start house sitting, allowing you to stay in one destination for a while without having to pay for accommodation. Everyone’s account is verified and has reviews so you know you won’t get cheated. This is a great way to travel long-term, with an important added bonus: you get a kitchen to cook your food (which saves you even more money!). You will also often get access to a vehicle and sometimes will be left a tip or free groceries. It’s generally people who are well enough off that they can afford multi-month vacations, so you’re usually in pretty nice homes and apartments too! The best website for this is Trusted Housesitters. You can read this post to learn more about how to start house sitting.
  Does your colleague have a relative in Spain? Or maybe you have a distant cousin who lives in New Zealand. Or maybe a childhood friend of yours is working down in Brazil. These days, we have a vast social network of friends and family that stretches across the globe. Don’t hesitate to use that! Ask your co-workers and friends if they know anyone where you’re going. Get your mom to ask her co-workers and friends, too. Using your social network can be hugely helpful in traveling the world. You never know who knows who! ***By implementing a variety of these tips, you’ll be able to travel for relatively little money. With a little planning and some creativity, you can travel the world for cheap. Because if I can do it, you can do it too! Whether it’s two months, two years, or just a two-week vacation, travel doesn’t need to cost a ton. The key is to get out of the mindset that you must travel in the typical manner of simply booking a flight and a hotel. Using out-of-the-box, nontraditional ways to travel can lead to big savings. But it all starts with a change in mindset. From there, with some patience and practice, you’ll be able to make your travel dreams a reality — without breaking the bank!

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/airbnb-experiences-nyc/," There’s a lot of tours in New York City (I’ve highlighted my favorites here) but I think one thing people don’t do enough of is Airbnb experience. Most of us know Airbnb through their stay features but they also have a lot of experiences where you can get a local to show you around. I actually like these experiences more than traditional tours because they have locals who share something they are passionate about, they are small groups, and they are usually a bit more off the beaten path. I don’t think people take these tours enough and they are always one of my favorite things to look for whenever I travel anywhere in the world. New York City has a ton of options you can choose from. Here are my favorites: Pizza and NYC go hand in hand like bread and butter and this Brooklyn pizza tour run by travel writer Dani Hienrich takes you to some of the best spots in the city while also giving you a really detailed history of pizza in the city (who knew slives weren’t a thing until the 1940s!). I’ve taken a lot of pizza tours in the city and I think dani runs the best one because she explains the history, is super fun, and it’s a more off the beaten path tour so you’re not being herded around in a large group of twenty. Book here!
  In this fun experience, you visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art and meet,X, a seasoned artist who will guide you on a sketching journey. You’ll begin with a friendly introduction and sketching warm-ups, then walk through selected galleries pausing to draw iconic sculptures and artworks of your choice. Along the way, he’ll also explain the history of sculpting and painting techniques and the sotry behind some of the exhibits. It’s definitely a fun and hands on way to explore the MET. Book here!
   On this walking tour in Lower Manhattan, you’ll meet your host Larry at the National Museum of the American Indian and then walk through a tapestry of hidden Black New York: from the site of Bowling Green (where enslaved Africans helped build the city), to remnants of Fort Amsterdam, and to the location of the 17th-century enslaved houses. You’ll pass Wall Street to learn about its slave-market past, visit Federal Hall and a former free-African oyster house, walk through Foley Square (site of the original execution grounds), and conclude at the African Burial Ground National Monument. Larry is one of the best tour guides I have ever had. He’s so fun, engaging, funny, and filled with a ton of knowledge. I love this tour and learned a lot on it. It’s such a cool and unique way to see lower Manhattan. He also runs an amazing Harlem tour too! Book here!
   If you want to do more than eat pizza, visit Paulie Gee’s, where your host Logan will guide you through the history of New York–style pizza before you shape your own dough, choose from a variety of sauces and toppings, fire your creation in a wood-fired oven. Afterwards, you’ll sit down to eat your creation as well as some other famous dishes from the restaurant. It’s run and interactive and Logan is a really interesting and personable host. Located in Greepoint, it’s an area most tourists skip so afterwards be sure to explore this locals only part of town.  Book here!
 
*** The next time you’re in NYC and looking to do something fun and unique be sure to look into Airbnb Experiences as they are really fun and interesting. I’ve done a dozen or so of these and these ones I think are the absolute best out of those. But if you find one you love be sure to email me about it so I can check!  For more in-depth tips on NYC, check out my 100+ page guidebook written for budget travelers like you! It cuts out the fluff found in other guides and gets straight to the practical information you need to travel in the city that never sleeps.

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/there-is-no-tomorrow-in-travel/," As the sun rises on a new year, we look out on the horizon and commit to being a better version of ourselves. And often one of those commitments is travel. This year we will travel more, we say.  We ponder the exotic locations we hope to find ourselves in.  We think of the adventures we’ll go on and the people we’ll meet.  We begin to formulate plans, research trips, and save money. But, as the year progresses, most will abandon those dreams, forever pushing them off as life throws them curveballs that derail their aspirations.  Chances are, you’ll find a reason why today just isn’t the right day.  “Tomorrow,” you’ll say. “Today isn’t perfect, and I just have too many things to do. Now is not the right time.”  The “right time” is usually when you have more money or more time off, or when things aren’t so “crazy.” Then you’ll be able to travel. The stars need to align a little more, and things need to be a little less busy. But here’s a secret: it’s never going to be the right time to travel. The idea that the stars will align and you’ll find the perfect day to step out of your door and into the world is fantasy. Today might not be the perfect day — but neither is tomorrow. Tomorrow, you’ll find another excuse why you can’t go. Tomorrow, there will still be more bills to pay. Tomorrow, there still won’t be “enough” money. Tomorrow, there will still be someone’s wedding or birthday party to attend. Tomorrow, there will still be more planning to do. Tomorrow, people you know will still sow the seeds of doubt in your head. Tomorrow, you’ll still worry about all the bad stuff that might happen to you. Tomorrow, you still won’t know if you’re making the right decision. Tomorrow, you will still second-guess yourself. Tomorrow, something else will come up and you’ll say to yourself, “Today isn’t the right day. Let’s try again tomorrow.” Tomorrow will never be perfect. Because there is no such thing as perfection.  I mean, doesn’t it feel like so much of adult life is saying, “Next week will just be a little better” — knowing full that next week is not going to be any less crazy than this week? The hardest part of any journey is stepping out the door. And one of the key components to making that first step easier is to understand that the stars will never align and there will never be the right moment to travel.  You just have to go. You have to leap. You have to trust yourself that it will all work out.  Because it will.  If I had waited for the perfect day when my friend said he would join (he never did) or when I had just a bit more money, I’d still be home in my cubicle job.  Back then, I was constantly worried I hadn’t saved enough money. I was constantly worried I didn’t have the skills to survive on the road.  There was always a reason to put off my trip.  But sometimes, you just have to take the leap and go for it. Ships aren’t meant to stay in a harbor. You weren’t meant to stay at home and wonder “what if?”  Because one day, you’ll run out of tomorrows. And you’ll be filled with nothing but sadness and regret. So stop waiting. Stop making excuses.  This is your year. It doesn’t matter if you can only save a dollar per day. Just start. Action begets action.  Don’t worry too much about tomorrow. Everything will work out.  Your bills will disappear when you cancel the services that generate them.  You’ll make more friends on the road than you could ever imagine.  You can work overseas.  And if it doesn’t work out, you can always come home.  The world is full of possibilities. And you’re capable of doing great things.  But only if you start today!

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/everyone-say-im-running-away/," When I first started traveling, my dad used to ask what I’m running away from with my travels. Another time, a commenter told me to stop running away from my problems and to start living life. “Grow up,” he said.  And, years ago, there was even a blog called “Mom says I’m running away.” I’m not sure why, but there is this perception out there that anyone who travels long term and isn’t interested in settling down or getting a conventional job must be running away from something.  We travelers are running away from responsibility, being a grown-up, heartache, problems, etc, etc. We are all just Peter Pans refusing to be “adults.” While American society thinks traveling is something everyone should do at one point, it’s only gap years after college or short vacations that seem to be acceptable. Get it out of your system and come back into The Matrix.  Those of us who lead nomadic lifestyles, or who linger just a bit too long somewhere before reaching that final homestretch, are all too often accused of running away. Yes, go travel — but not for too long, the world says. Responsible people don’t just travel forever.  We nomads must have awful, miserable lives, or are weird, or have had something traumatic happen to us that we are trying to escape. People assume that we are simply running away from our problems, running away from “the real world.” And to all those people who think I am running away, I say: you are right.  I am running away. I’m running away from your idea of the “real” world. I’m avoiding your life. I’m running towards everything — towards the world, exotic places, new people, different cultures, and my own idea of freedom. I’m building a life that makes me happy.  While there may be exceptions (as there are with everything), most people who become nomads do so because they want to experience the world, not escape their problems. They are running away from office life, commutes, and weekend errands, and the corporate 9 to 5. They are running away from the strict path society has laid out as “normal.” The one that makes us mindless ants marching to and fro. We (I) want to experience every culture, see every mountain, eat different food, attend crazy festivals, meet new people, and enjoy different holidays around the world. We want to construct a life that makes us happy on our own terms.  Life is short and we only get to live it once. I want to look back and say I did exciting things and lived life on my own terms, not say I spent my life reading blogs like this during my lunch break while wishing I was doing the same thing. No one dies saying, “If only I had spent more time in the office!” As an American, my perspective might be different. In my country, the accepted path is long and narrow: you go to college, get a job, get married, buy a house, have 2.5 children, raise them, and then retire. Only then, after you’ve put in your time, can you enjoy the fruits of your labor. Society boxes you in and restricts your movements to their expectations. And any deviation is considered abnormal and weird.  People may want to travel, tell you they envy what you do, and say they wish they could do the same thing. But they never do. Few people muster the courage to take the leap, no matter how much their heart pulls them. They are simply fascinated by a lifestyle so outside the norm.  While social media, the rise of digital nomading, and websites like this have made quitting your job to travel the world or teach English in Thailand a little more acceptable, the general attitude is still “follow the path if you want to be normal.” Well, I don’t want to be normal. I feel like the reason why people tell us we are running away is that they can’t fathom the fact that we broke the mold and are living outside the norm. To want to break all of society’s conventions, there simply must be something wrong with us. (Maybe they are a little jealous too?) But life is what you make it out to be. Life is yours to create. We are all chained down by the burdens we place upon ourselves, whether they are bills, errands, or, like me, self-imposed blogging deadlines. If you really want something, you have to go after it. People who travel the world aren’t running away from life. Just the opposite. Those that break the mold, explore the world, and live on their own terms are running toward true living, in my opinion. We have a degree of freedom a lot of people will never experience. We get to be the captains of our ships.  But it is a freedom we chose to have.  We looked around and said, “I want something different.”  And then we went for it. It was that freedom and attitude I saw in travelers years ago in Thailand that inspired me to do lead the life I am now. I saw them break the mold and I thought to myself, “Why not me?”  I’m not running away. No.  I am just running towards my own idea of a normal life. And I never plan to look back.

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-travel-gifts/," Travelers can be a fickle group of people to buy gifts for. We’re constantly coming and going, we usually don’t carry a lot of stuff with us, and no two travelers are alike. Finding the perfect gift for the traveler in your life can be tricky. While a plane ticket is never a bad idea (I’m a window seat in case anyone is thinking of getting me one), I’ve put together this ultimate gift guide for travelers as there’s a lot of great travel gear out there these days that helps people travel cheaper and better. Even me, the gear-adverse traveler, likes a lot of this stuff! This is stuff I actually think is super useful. No nonsense. No fluff. Just the best gifts for intrepid travelers and globetrotting nomads. This simple item is one of the most important for the budget traveler. Since many hostels have lockers, backpackers need to have their own travel lock when they’re on the road. While you can usually rent them at hostels, those prices add up after a while. I never leave home without a lock because I know it will come in handy. Buy now on Amazon!
  Anyone who has ever stayed in a hostel knows that a quality pair of earplugs is a necessity. From chronic snorers to late-night drinkers to copulating couples in creaking bunks, hostels are known for their less-than-quiet accommodation. I suggest investing in good earplugs and not just the cheap foam ones. Not only will they help you sleep, but they’re great for bus trips and flights as well as wearing as you explore louder, more hectic cities. Buy now on Amazon!
  Nothing is more tedious than arriving at a new destination only to realize you can’t charge your devices because the electrical outlets are different. That’s why you’ll need a travel adapter. They’re a simple accessory. There’s a million out there but this is one I use as it covers every region of the world and comes with USB ports too. It’s cheap, easy to use, and lightweight. Everything you need in an adapter. Buy now on Amazon!
  
Zbiotics Pre-Alcohol is a pre-drink probiotic that helps you really avoid those rough mornings after drinking.

It will make your next mornings bright and it helps me ensure that I’m not feeling too bad to do stuff the next day. I love this product. It works. If you or a traveler on your gift list drinks, take it. You can save 10% off with the code NOMADICMATT. Buy now on Zbiotics!

While there are tons of expensive and fancy passport holders out there, a simple one will get the job done and save you money in the process (money you can spend on more travels!). Buy now on Amazon!

Dry shampoo is a convenient liquid-free alternative to regular shampoo. It’s a useful minimalist solution for budget travelers who travel carry-on only and an eco-friendly choice as well.

  Unless you’re only staying at hotels or using Airbnb, you’re going to need to bring a towel when you travel. Having a lightweight, quick-drying towel makes a huge difference when you’re on the road since regular towels are too bulky and heavy (and they take a long time to dry). Get a travel towel for your next trip so you can travel light. They’re a compact, quick-drying solution that every backpacker needs. (Use code “nomadicmatt” for 15% off your purchase!) Buy now at DryFoxCo!
  Menstrual cups are reusable, eco-friendly feminine hygiene products. While I can’t speak to their effectiveness personally, tons of female travelers I know are huge fans.

  This is a handy tool for both backpackers and anyone looking to do any hiking or camping. In a hostel, a headlamp is helpful if you need to check in or out but don’t want to disturb your fellow travelers. For outdoorsy folks, they’re useful for hiking, setting up camp in the dark, and for emergencies. Buy now on Amazon!
  These days, we all travel with numerous electronic devices like phones and tablets. It can be hard to keep them all charged. An external battery solves that problem. Two high-output USB ports make this external battery incredibly convenient, and it can charge most phones up to 6 times in one go! Buy now on Amazon!
  Environmentally, pollution from single-use plastics is something every traveler has witnessed. And, monetarily, when you’re traveling, continuously buying water gets expensive. Do your part to help the planet by traveling with a reusable filter. LifeStraw is an awesome brand with a built-in water filter. The filters last 5 years so you save money on changing them too. Buy now on Lifestraw!
  If you’ve got a budget traveler on your holiday list, a travel backpack is the gift that keeps on giving. A well-made bag will last for years and through dozens of adventures. Having a reliable travel backpack is one of the most important items for a traveler. My favorite bag is the Flash 55 from REI but other companies that make high-quality bags include Osprey, Nomatic, and MEC (for Canadians). For a smaller day bag, check out the Flash 22. Or if you prefer a bag with wheels, check out the Farpoint 36. For more backpack suggestions, check out my ultimate guide finding the right backpack for more options!
  These travel clothes are some of the most versatile on the market. Made from merino wool, Unbound offers clothing that can be worn daily for weeks (and months!) without getting smelly.

  This is my favorite travel computer. It’s light, it’s powerful enough for regular use, and the battery life lasts a long time.

When I’m on the road, this is the laptop I travel with. Buy now on Amazon!
 
For a non-Apple phone with an equally awesome camera, check out the Google Pixel. It has an excellent camera!
  These are ideal for those long flights or bus trips as they block out background noise so you can read, work, or sleep without being disturbed. The wireless Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones are fan favorites and my go-to brand. They are comfortable, rechargeable, and do an amazing job at removing background noise. If you’re on a budget, consider the QuietComfort 25 instead. Buy now on Amazon!
  While I personally prefer to read physical books, I can’t argue against the convenience and simplicity of the Kindle. Hauling around physical books is a pain if you’re traveling often. With a Kindle, you can pack over 1,000 books into a single device and many versions can also use apps and access the internet. It’s a wonderful gift for the avid reader. Buy now on Amazon!
  Every traveler needs a camera, and few are as versatile and durable as the GoPro. They’re incredible for photos and video no matter the climate. They’re waterproof and are perfect for both everyday city exploring as well as more extreme and adventurous activities. They’re just awesome. If the Hero 12 is too pricey, grab the 10 or 11. They’re almost as good and a bit cheaper!

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/expensive-airfare/," I’ve been traveling for close to twenty years. In that time, the airline industry has changed a lot. The use of points and miles has become widespread, round-the-world tickets have gone the way of the dodo, airlines have consolidated, and there has been an explosion of budget airlines. Over the last few years, the cost of airline tickets has steadily risen. They get more and more expensive while their prices often seem illogical. Since ticket pricing is an arcane and misunderstood subject, I want to take some time to explain why your airplane ticket costs what it does. Ticket prices have increased over the decade for several reasons. For starters, the industry has consolidated a lot over the last few decades. Thanks to bankruptcies and mergers, there are now only three major alliance airlines (American, Delta, and United) in the United States. And, with the recent bankruptcy of Spirit and the merger of Alaska and Hawaiian, there’s even less competition outside the Big 3. In Canada, there are only two major airlines – WestJet and Air Canada. In Europe, Air France–KLM, British Airways IAG, and Lufthansa control the bulk of the market. (Though, thankfully, in Europe, there are lots of budget airlines to choose from.) As airlines have partnered up, merged, or gone bankrupt, there is little incentive to provide low fares to win your business. After all, when only one or two airlines are flying a route, airlines know you don’t have much choice. Less competition means higher prices. Secondly, the price of airline fuel has increased tremendously. Back in 2017, jet fuel cost $1.37 per gallon. In 2024, it is $6.49 per gallon! Airlines have simply passed that fivefold increase on to the consumer. Thirdly, airline taxes and security fees have increased a lot, adding to the cost of your ticket. Ever fly into London? Half the ticket price is made up of fees and taxes! Finally, demand fell following the 2008 recession, and to compensate, airlines reduced both the number of routes they offered and the frequency of their flights. Fuller planes mean more passenger revenue and fewer costs for the airline. That trend greatly accelerated during COVID. When COVID shut down global travel, airlines mothballed many of their older planes and laid off many of their staff. When travel restrictions were lifted and more people started flying again, they didn’t have enough planes or staff to return to a pre-COVID schedule. This decrease in the supply of flights, coupled with the surge in demand for travel, meant that airlines had little incentive to lower prices. According to Rick Seaney of Farecompare.com, “Before 2008, things were in favor of the passengers. After the 2009 crisis, the scale of justice tipped towards the airlines.” Taken together, a consolidated airline industry that is facing more costs is simply less likely to generally offer lower fares. Prices go up and down for many reasons. There are four major factors that drive prices are competition, supply, demand, and oil prices. Together, those four things affect something called “the load factor.” Airlines want to fill their planes and maximize profits, and they do this by calculating a plane’s load factor. Essentially, this is the percentage of seats sold on a flight. They want this number to be as high as possible. To get the highest possible load factor, airlines will constantly change prices based on the four categories above in order to get people to buy tickets. Airlines use dynamic pricing models and artificial intelligence (AI) to figure out the maximum value they can get for each seat. Have you ever wondered why airlines seem to callously raise their prices after a big event spikes demand? They aren’t. The AI is. All it sees is sky-high demand and adjusts accordingly to its programming. More demand = higher prices. These advanced computer systems constantly compare booking trends to past sales history, major events, concerts, sporting events, weather, and competitor behavior. They can look at consumer searching and booking behavior and process lots and lots of data and change prices on the fly (no pun intended) in hopes of getting the best price possible. All of this is why one day a flight may cost $100, then $400 the next, and then back to $100 the day after that. As people buy seats on a flight, airlines raise prices, and when demand falls (at a certain price point), they lower prices until fewer and fewer seats are available, then they will raise prices again. It’s a delicate balance designed to ensure maximum revenue. It’s why prices are cheapest for 5 AM flights, more expensive over the holidays, and through the roof during peak season or if there’s a major sports event in town. After all, you can’t add more seats to a plane, so all they can do to raise revenue is charge higher fares! It’s also why prices might change in seconds. It’s not because they are tracking your cookies, it’s because the AI is responding to real-time changes in seats. Think about it. How many booking companies are out there? Lots! All of them are reserving seats. Millions of people fly each day and, with limited routes, it’s easier to fill planes, so the AI doesn’t need to discount fares as much as it had to in the past. On a US domestic flight, there might be 10–15 different price points. If the load factor is low and demand is low, an airline will increase the availability of cheap fares. If the load factor is high and demand is high, the airline will raise prices. As Rick said, the airline is advantaged now. But it’s not impossible to find a cheap ticket. There are many, many ways to find cheap airfare. To avoid being the person who paid the most for their ticket, the main thing to do is to be flexible. Airlines are constantly changing prices to increase revenue, hoping to get people into the highest price buckets possible. “About three months before, airlines start to manage those bottom price points,” Rick says. That means airlines begin to look at historical trends and current seat sales to figure out whether they will release those really rock-bottom fares or keep prices high. If you’re booking inside a month, you’re playing into the airline’s hands. When your dates are no longer flexible, you’ll pay whatever they charge. To find out how to navigate this system and get a cheap flight, check out these articles I wrote: The days of cheap airfares are long over. They aren’t coming back, and the prices you see now are the new normal for airline tickets. They are simply going to cost a lot more, especially if you don’t find the sweet spot when prices are their lowest. But by understanding how tickets are priced, you can avoid being the person who pays the most.

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/find-cheap-car-rental/," I love road trips. You get in car and can just head off anywhere you want. There’s a freedom to a road trip that you can’t get with trains (and, don’t get me wrong, I love train travel too). Small towns, beautiful parks, historic buildings….whatever you see, you can stop for and can stay as little or as long as you’d like!  Over the years, I’ve been on dozens of road trips. Some destinations are just meant for them (think New Zealand, Ireland, Iceland, the United States, South Africa, etc, etc.). However, when you don’t have your own car, renting one can be a pain in the ass. No one likes doing it and we all (rightly) worry we’re getting ripped off. There’s always a lot of questions that go with renting a car. Where can I find the best deals? How do I know this cheap car rental site is legit?  What are things I should watch out for?  And what about insurance? Do I really need that? Or is my credit card’s insurance good enough?  In this post, I am going to share my tips and advice to help you find a cheap (but reliable) car rental and how to avoid common pitfalls that many travelers make. Table of ContentsStep 1: Join Rental Company Mailing Lists & Loyalty ProgramsStep 2: Search for a Car with Discover CarsStep 3: Check for Discounts & DealsStep 4: Check the Sharing EconomyStep 5: Book Your Car (and Book Early!)9 Questions to Ask Yourself Before You Rent a CarHow to Travel the World on $75 a Day

  Table of Contents Most rental car companies advertise deals to their subscribers first. As soon as you know that you’re going on a road trip, join the mailing lists of the major car rental company. That way, you can snag any deals on offer as soon as they are announced.  To find the main rental car companies in your destination, simply visit the website of the airport you’re arriving at and see what car rental companies are available there. Additionally, like airlines, many car rental companies have loyalty airlines that offer perks like discounts, bonus upgrades, and free rentals. Enterprise, Avis, Alamo, and Hertz are some of the major players on the market that offer free loyalty programs. Sign up for them so you don’t miss out on any perks, offers, or upgrades.
  While you can certainly check each car rental company individually for a deal, the best way to compare prices is to use an aggregator. These websites compile information from every car rental website so you don’t have to spend time manually comparing prices before you book. Discover Cars is the best car search aggregator to use as it pulls more cars from more websites to ensure you find the best deal (it searches over 500 websites for deals). It cover 165 countries and 50,000+ locations worldwide!  You can use the widget below to check prices and get a quote quickly and easily to compare rental car deals with DiscoverCars comparison tool for cheap rentals:

  Be sure to compare weekly and daily rates as well. For example, if you need a car for 4 days, compare the price for a 7-day trip as well. Sometimes it’s cheaper to rent for a whole week and just return the vehicle early.
  Some car rental websites share discounts directly on their website. For example, b oth Budget and Avis have “last minute deals” sections on their website where you can find incredible discounts as long as you’re flexible with your dates and destination. Most major car rental companies also offer discounts and deals to certain groups as well. For example, Avis offers up to 35% off to AARP members (AARP is an interest group in the U.S. for people 50 and over) while Budget offers up to 35% off to veterans. Check and see if there are any discounts or deals you qualify for before you book, such as corporate discounts, government discounts, senior discounts, or discounts that stem from any hotel or airline programs you are a part of.  Many travel credit cards also have perks or discounts for car rentals.
  Now that you’ve found the best deal, it’s time to do a quick comparison with sharing economy websites like Turo. Turo is like Airbnb but for cars. Locals list their vehicle and a price per day and you can browse the options and book a vehicle. It’s not available everywhere (they’re currently only in the United States, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada) but you can find it in most major cities. Depending on your needs and the duration of your trip, you might be able to find a cheaper deal. Renters need to be at least 21 years old, have a valid driver’s license, and have proof of a good auto insurance score. You can either pick up the car, have it dropped off, or meet the owner somewhere to get the keys. Prices can be as low as $25 USD per day, making it an affordable option if you book early. And, if you’re looking for an RV, check out RVShare, which is similar to Turo but focused solely on RVs and campervans. They have the largest inventory out there.  There’s also the website Imoova.com, where you relocate people’s vehicles for them. You’ll be on a deadline as vehicles need to be delivered by a certain date, however, rates are usually just $1 per day — and many include some money for gas too.
  Book early. Like booking flights, the closer you are to the date, the more expensive the car will be — assuming there are any left to rent! The recent pandemic saw car rental prices skyrocket as people shifted from trips abroad to road trips at home. The best time to rent a car is when you know you need to rent a car! Don’t wait.

Now that you’ve found a cheap car rental, here are some considerations to keep in mind before you book your rental:  1. Are there driver requirements? – Some countries charge extra if a driver is under 25 years of age. Others require a certain amount of driving experience before one can rent a car (usually one year). Each country has different requirements, so make sure you read the fine print before you book. You can learn more about getting an international driver’s license on this blog post. 2. What does your travel insurance policy require? – Car companies always push you to get extra insurance when you rent a car. But should you? That depends on whether you have your own travel insurance with collision coverage, your own car insurance, or coverage through your travel credit card.  Some travel insurance companies and credit cards want you to decline the insurance from the rental agency, while others insist you get it and make a claim with them first. Before you rent a car, make sure you understand what is required by your existing travel insurance plan. The credit cards listed here have really good car insurance coverage. 3. What is not included? – Once you find a rental car, companies usually try to sell you all kinds of extras. GPS, liability insurance, satellite radio, a children’s car seat — these are just some of the extras not included in most rental cars. Find out what is and isn’t included, so you aren’t surprised when picking up your vehicle.  4. Do you need to fill the tank at the end? – Some rental car companies allow you to drop off the car as is but that is really rare. Most insist you fill up the tank beforehand. If you don’t, they charge you a highly inflated fee for the gas when they fill it up. I always just fill the tank back up before I drop the car back off.  5. How can you avoid getting scammed? – Before you head out on your trip, take pictures and videos of the car. Specifically, the bumper, windshield, and tires as these are the most likely areas to get damaged. That way, when you return it, they can’t blame you for any pre-existing damage. I always walk through with the person handing me the car and do a walk through with someone when I drop it off.  6. Do you have unlimited mileage? – Unlimited mileage is slowly becoming standard. However, it’s not always the default, check that you have unlimited mileage for longer road trips. Otherwise, you’ll be counting miles so you don’t get billed extra. 7. Do they charge for an extra driver? – If you’re going on a road trip with friends or family, chances are you’ll be sharing the driving. Unless you’re going with a spouse or domestic partner (which some companies include as an additional driver for free), that means you need to pay a fee for an extra driver, usually $10-20 USD per day! Limit your extra drivers if that’s the case, otherwise you’ll be charged a fortune. Also, keep in mind that it’s illegal to charge fees for extra drivers in some places (such as California). 8. Where is the pickup/drop-off location? – Most travelers pick up their rental cars at the airport. While convenient, airports charge companies fees for operating there — fees that get passed onto the customer. It’s worth checking around to see if there’s a difference in price for off-airport locations. If they are easy to reach, chances are you can find a cheaper price there. 9. Is the car automatic or manual transmission? – If you’re from the US or Canada and are used to driving an automatic vehicle, you might be surprised when renting a car abroad, as manual transmissions are standard in most other parts of the world. Because of this, renting an automatic-transmission car is usually more expensive. Double-check that you’re renting a vehicle that you can actually drive (don’t take chances trying to teach yourself on a rental car).    *** Road trips are one of the best ways to explore a new destination and the freedom of having a car is unrivaled, allowing you to get off the beaten path and into all kinds of adventures. And knowing a few things before you rent a car can save you a lot of time, hassle, and expensive pricing.

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/common-travel-myths/," Years ago, the website Earth Porm reposted my article “The Ultimate Guide to Traveling When You’re Broke.” As I went through the comments on the post, I was dismayed by the mean and dismissive comments people shared as well their misconceptions about travel.  These comments made me realize that, despite all the detailed websites and books on how to make travel affordable and accessible, too many people still believe the notion that travel is expensive, unsafe, and impossible unless you are rich. Too many say, “I can’t. It’s impossible” and become cynical about travel. The notion that travel is expensive couldn’t be further from the truth (I wrote an entire book proving that very point.)   Yet people still have all kinds of misconceptions about budget travel and staying safe abroad.  So, today, I want to debunk 7 of the most common travel myths I’ve encountered over the years:
  
Everything costs some money — and that includes travel. But the idea that travel is only about fancy tours, beach-side resorts, and luxurious villas is outdated. Traditionally, subtle marketing language made everyone believe that “a fun vacation is an expensive vacation.” After decades of being bombarded by those insidious ad campaigns, our collective consciousness still equates travel with luxury. Heck, I used to believe this too. But the fact of the matter is you don’t need a trust fund or a high-paying job to have an amazing trip.  You’ll need to learn how to plan a trip. You’ll need to save money. But you don’t need to be rich to travel. You just need to be creative and have the right priorities. And it can even be done on minimum wage. Sure, it may take longer to save for your trip, and you may need to make sacrifices, but if you want to travel — whether for two weeks or two years — you can find a way to make it happen. Here are some starting points that can help you lower your costs and travel on a budget:   
Collecting points and miles is the art of using travel credit cards to gain free travel by using your regular spending. No extra purchases. No jumping through loopholes. Just earning free travel by putting your date nights, groceries, gas, and other regular expenses on a travel card.  I can’t count the number of free flights and hotel stays I’ve had over the years. By collecting points and miles, I’ve been able to travel for a fraction of the price it would have cost otherwise, opening up tons of possibilities for budget travel. While applying for credit cards will cause a temporary dip in your credit score, that dip gets corrected within two months if you keep paying off your bills. Unless you’re looking to make a huge purchase (like buying a house) in the near future, that minor dip will not affect you. Over time, having more available credit will actually improve your credit score. And I mean what’s the point of building up a credit score if you don’t use it? You work to build a good credit score for the purpose of doing things with it.  I have over a dozen credit cards (though I only actively use three) and a credit score of 797 out of 850. As long as you pay your card off each month, you don’t need to worry. Here are some resources to help you get started:    
Couchsurfing is a sharing economy app that facilitates cultural exchange. Locals offer a free space in their home (sometimes just a couch) which travelers can use to then visit the city and learn about about the destination. While staying in a stranger’s house might not be for everyone, it’s nevertheless a safe and fun way to travel (not to mention an affordable one). Much like Airbnb, Couchsurfing hosts have reviews and profiles you can read to make sure you’re staying with someone you feel you’d get along with. It’s really not much different than Airbnb (except it’s free!). Of course, if you’re not ready to stay with a stranger you can also use to app to meet people for activities instead, such as a meal, coffee, or a museum visit. It’s a great way to benefit from the app without having to stay with someone. As long as you use common sense, read reviews, and trust your gut, you’ll be able to use the app safely while saving money and having fun. There are families who host people, solo female hosts who only host women, as well as expats looking to connect with fellow foreigners.  Couchsurfing and websites like it have vibrant communities. Because, contrary to what the news and media like to report, not everyone out there is a secret murderer looking for their next victim. Most people are good, kind people just looking to make friends and learn new things. Don’t let fear limit your opportunities.
  
Hitchhiking is a relatively common way to travel in many countries around the world. It was also a common (and safe) way to travel the US and Canada for a long while too. The idea that hitchhiking is dangerous dates back to the 1950s when the FBI led a scare campaign to get people to stop the practice, in part because civil rights activists were hitchhiking to rallies. The FBI’s campaign permanently embedded in the mind of people that hitchhiking is dangerous by claiming that most hitchhikers were murderers.  Combined with a narrative pushed by the media that the world is unsafe, hitchhiking continues to be perceived as a dangerous activity — even if it’s not. My friend hitchhiked solo around the US. Kristin from Be My Travel Muse hitchhiked around China  I’ve hitchhiked in Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America and met wonderful, interesting people in the process. Hitchhiking, like Couchsurfing, is about using common sense. Make a note of license plates, have a phone in case of an emergency, and travel with a friend if you’re not comfortable going solo. And remember, you don’t have to get into any car that stops. Use your judgment and follow your instincts and you’ll be able to meet lots of interesting people while still staying safe.
  
While both men and women face risks on the road, women often encounter additional hazards that require caution and awareness. But that doesn’t mean women need to stay home or only go to super-safe destinations. The “if it bleeds, it leads” approach to reporting over the years has highlighted only the negative stories of female travelers. This style of reporting bolsters the perceptions that the world is so scary that solo female travel is very, very unsafe and should be avoided.  Fortunately, that’s not true at all. You have a higher chance of getting hit by a bus than you do of ending up like in the movie Taken. But don’t just take my word for it. Here’s an excerpt from a post on women’s safety: If I look back on the times when people have told me “Don’t go there!” or “You might die!” it’s mostly advice from people who have never been to those places and have never done any research on them. The press is hugely influential. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve read international press coverage that is flat-out wrong. You need to find trustworthy sources and advice from people who know what they’re talking about. I once mentioned to my parents that I had plans to go to Rwanda. My concerned father told me, “You’re not going.” He was obviously worried about Rwanda’s tumultuous past. Had he done his research, he would have known that Rwanda is the safest country in East Africa. Once he researched it, I never heard another word about it. The crime rates in your backyard can be just as bad as the destination you’re headed to, if not worse. These days, there are tons of powerful, independent female creators traveling to all corners of the world — including off-the-beaten-path countries. Heck, many of them are more adventurous than I am! Here are some to follow for inspiration:   
Too many people believe travel is something you can do only if you’re young or single. That couldn’t be further from the truth. I understand that when you are older, you may want more luxury than a budget backpacker. And I know that family travel requires more planning than solo travel. B ut travel is not solely the purview of the young.  At the end of the day, age doesn’t matter. I’ve seen families and seniors backpacking around the world, staying in hostels, or driving RVs. You don’t need to be limited by age or your relationship status. Here are some articles that prove both families and seniors can travel on a budget:   
We often think of working abroad as an challenging process not worth the effort. It’s something that requires interviews, visas, and a polished résumé. But, for the kind of jobs that you’ll get as a traveler, that’s not true.  If you want to work and are flexible about what you’re willing to do, you can find employment almost anywhere. You can get a working holiday in countries like Australia or New Zealand, become an au pair, teach English, or even volunteer in exchange for room and board. Sure, you might not get a fancy or well-paying job. But if your priority is travel then what does that matter? Farms, schools, bars, restaurants, cafes, and the tourism industry are almost always looking for staff — especially in areas with a seasonal influx of tourists. You won’t get rich, but you will get to see the world. If you want to learn more about your options, here are some blog posts to get you started: *** These travel myths come from years of being indoctrinated with the belief that travel has to be expensive and the world is scary. That couldn’t be further from the truth. With a little research, you’ll discover that traveling the world is much safer — and much more affordable — than most people think.

NomadicMatt,https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/guide-renting-apartments/," I used to hate renting apartments from websites like Airbnb or VRBO. As a solo traveler, I preferred the social atmosphere of hostels. You met people, hostels ran activities and they were where you were “supposed to stay” as a backpacker.  When I did want something other than a hostel, I used a hospitality network liked Couchsurfing or simply stayed with friends. But, after close to two decades as a nomad, there are times when I like my privacy and the ability to “create a home.” I like to cook, want to relax on a couch, and just chill. While apartment rentals often contribute to overtourism (discussed more below), there are still plenty of real hosts out there who are renting places they live in.  Below is a detailed guide about how they work, how to pick the perfect apartment, and how not to contribute to overtourism / make locals upset! Table of ContentsHow Do Apartment Rentals Work?How to Pick the Right ApartmentA Note on SafetyThe Best Sites to Find a Rental ApartmentHow to Travel the World on $75 a Day

  Table of Contents 
Apartment rental sites allow locals to rent out an individual room, shared space, or entire home/apartment. The host lists their place online, posts photos, writes a description, hits publish, and, presto, they can start to make extra money with the unused space. The booking process is like booking any other type of accommodation online. You search the database, find a place you like, create an account, and request a booking. When the owner accepts, you are sent a confirmation.  Apartment rentals represent the space between hostels and hotels. If you are traveling on business and want the comforts of home, you probably aren’t going to stay in a hostel. But hotels may be too expensive or too impersonal for you. A rented apartment is a perfect compromise. Traveling with friends or a big group? This is definitely the option for you. Squeezing a bunch of people into a rental home/apartment will be much cheaper per person than a room in a hostel or hotel. Plus, you get space to spread out and relax. Dorm rooms and cramped hotels don’t give you a lot of “me” time. If you don’t want a full apartment but are looking to save money,  Airbnb has a new feature called “Rooms” which lets you search for listings in people’s homes or guest houses. It’s like how Airbnb used to be — people renting out extra rooms or guest houses for added cash. You always get your own room and, sometimes, a private entrance. You’ll also get to interact with your host, who can provide lots of insider tips and insight to your destination.  I’ve used Rooms a lot in the last couple of years — in LA, Rome, Paris, Nice — and, to me, as a solo traveler, it’s a much better way to travel. I highly recommend doing this as a way to combat the negative effects of these platforms (more on that below). Additionally, as hostels have gotten a lot more expensive over the years, Rooms are often cheaper than hostels! You get to stay and meet with a local and save money! Win-win! 
Unfortunately, as accommodation rentals have exploded into the mainstream, it’s become harder and harder to find great hosts. A lot of hosts now own multiple properties and live elsewhere. That means you often deal with property managers and never get to interact with the actual owner.  Additionally, a lot of apartments aren’t quite as nice in reality as they appear in the photos. In order to find suitable accommodation, I use the following criteria when looking for a place to stay on these platforms:  These rules are helpful guidelines, but at the end of the day, you have to go with your gut. I don’t need a listing to meet every point. I once had a host who hit only a couple of these points and she turned out to be my favorite host! And sometimes, in places without many hosts, you might have to be a little loose with this list. But the more points a place meets, the comfortable I feel renting. How to Avoid Overtourism
Over the years, Airbnb and other apartment rental websites have dramatically raised the price of rents and pushed out the locals you want to interact with as people have started to buy multiple properties in order to rent them out to tourists. It’s a big problem.  In many places, like Lisbon and Venice, most locals can’t afford the price of rent anymore. And it’s not just cities. Rural areas are now becoming affected too.  There have been strong protests against Airbnb (and similar sites) in Barcelona. Throughout Europe you often see “Airbnb go home!” graffiti. Japan cracked down on Airbnb. NYC has strict laws against it now too. Residents in Mexico City have protested. Every day brings a new story about the pushback against these websites. Given local pushback and the issues with over tourism and the housing market,  I strongly encourage you to only use Airbnb or similar services if you are renting a room in someone’s house, especially in large cities in Europe. As I mentioned above, Airbnb has a new feature called “Rooms” which allows you to easily search for rooms in people’s houses where they actually live. They are verified listings and a much better way to use the platform. It’s like how Airbnb used to be before it grew so big — people renting out extra rooms or guest houses for added cash. I highly recommend it. However, if you can’t, try as hard as you can to make sure that the place you are renting is either a licensed B&B (if it’s only used for tourists) or someone’s house that they actually live in. This way you won’t add to any local housing issues!  Help end overtourism. You have the power. Don’t displace the people you want to visit!  
These sites run on trust. All these companies try to verify both buyer and seller to ensure no one ends up robbing anyone else, but you sometimes hear reports of sex parties, robberies, or creepy hosts. However, apartment rental companies do provide a window that allows you to get your money back if you get a place that’s not as advertised. Just call their 24-hour hotline and they will set you up somewhere else (you can also reach out on social media to get the conversation started). They also hold your money in escrow so that if the place isn’t as advertised, you’ll get your money back. You never hand it over directly to the host. All types of accommodations have risks (cleaners can steal from hotel rooms, dorm mates can take clothes from hostels, Couchsurfing hosts can get creepy), which is why these rules are important. I don’t think apartment rentals are any less safe than your other options, and the benefits greatly outweigh the perceived danger. I think these are three best sites for finding an apartment: Another option for long-term travelers is house sitting and pet sitting. In exchange for looking after someone’s property or pet while they travel, you get access to free accommodation. It’s a great option for slow/long-term travelers looking to stay in one location for longer periods of time. Check out this post to learn more about it! *** Apartment rentals, when done right, are safe, affordable, and help you have a more authentic experience. Use the tips above and try one on your next trip. You’ll save money, get away from the tourists, and have a better trip!

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-travel-gear-packing-guide/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  One of the most common questions I get from readers is, “What do I pack for a trip?” So, I’ve put together a series of packing guides for female travelers. This travel gear packing guide covers all of the essentials, electronics, and camera gear I bring on each of my trips. While I may not pack the same clothes for every trip, these are the things I bring no matter where I go. As a frequent traveler, blogger, and photographer, I invest in high-quality gear that is also lightweight and will last for years to come. The last thing I want is an uncomfortable backpack for a long-term trip or cheap electronics that are going to break shortly after the first use. I learned (the hard way) that constantly replacing worn-out gear ends up costing a lot more than investing in high-quality equipment from the start. Get durable gear, even if it costs a little more, and you’ll see that it saves money in the end! Here is a list of gear I use, but keep in mind that not everything is suitable or necessary for every trip of type or traveler. In particular, I travel with a lot of electronics and photography equipment to keep this travel blog up to date. Use this guide to determine what you need at the very most and eliminate from it to create your packing list. Veken packing cubes are perfect for nearly every type of trip and really help to organize everything. A durable bag and a gear backpack are key to protect and transport all of your items. Same with a toiletry bag—just in case there’s a mishap and things spill, at least they’re contained! I never go anywhere without a reusable water bottle as they’re ideal for filling up at the airport or wherever there is potable water available. As travelers around the globe are dealing with way more lost and delayed luggage than ever before, I highly recommend investing in Apple Air Tags to be able to track the location of your items at all times. You can attach them to your keys, backpack, or camera bags, and even slip one into your checked luggage for flights!  Travel is so much easier when you have the right kind of bag for the trip. After years of travel, here's my best luggage, bags and backpack recommendations! Whether you're taking a short flight or a transatlantic flight, this carry-on packing guide will ensure you are prepared for a comfortable journey. To maintain this blog, I travel with a virtual office. I definitely pack more electronics than most people would ever require. So, again, assume this is the most you’ll need and eliminate it from it to make your packing list. Most folks won’t need *everything* on this list—but I highly suggest a hard drive and a universal travel adapter. I’ve lost photos and nearly lost hours of footage because my laptop gave up…but backing everything up on my hard drive allows me to save all those precious photos and videos. A USB charger is also an ideal thing to snag before a trip—especially if you’re using your phone to navigate constantly and don’t know where the nearest charging station will be. You can simply charge while you’re on the road! This is the camera equipment & photography gear I use for travel photography. For a complete list of cameras and lenses, check out my photography gear for travel post! The best way to step up your photography game? Learn how to use your camera and all of its settings by photographing in Manual Mode! I’ve got tons of tips and tricks over on my photography page—so dive in to get those incredible travel shots. I love being able to share my passion for photography on my blog, on Instagram, and on the photography tours I lead in South Africa! I’d highly recommend investing in some of the essential pieces and truly evaluating what you would and would not use on your trip—no need to carry excess luggage or items if you’re not actually going to use them!

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-couples-travel-bucket-list/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  Over this past year we have had countless honeymoon-quality trips and adventures, and we aren’t even engaged yet!  As one might expect, we’ve developed quite an awesome couples’ travel bucket list that we wanted to share with you all. Here are our top picks of must-do adventures for your couples’ travel bucket list!   Positano is the absolute epitome of a naturally beautiful, cliff side city by the sea coupled with truly amazing people, and some of the most delicious food one can find in all of Italy. Rent a kayak by the hour from the main dock and spend your day exploring hidden beaches and enjoying the breathtaking coastal views… castles included!   When you can rent a snorkel and mask on the beach for $3 there is no reason not to take advantage of the crystal clear warm water that the Gili Islands has to offer! Gili Meno in particular is known for having tons of sea turtles and beautiful fish. No need to even rent a boat if you stay on Gili Meno, you can simply walk out to the water in front of your hotel and make some new turtle friends!    Amsterdam is one of the most beautiful cities we have ever been to. Take a romantic boat ride through the canals, or even just enjoy the views from above! The city is full of architecture, unique culture, and delicious food—our favorite thing were the stroopwafels! Also, if you both love good music and dancing, attending Amsterdam Music Festival and the Amsterdam Dance Event are imperative!   Kiss in the middle of the madness. There’s something special about how love can stop time. Walk into the middle of Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo, Japan (during a green light of course), stop in the middle of the road, and just stand there kissing for a minute. You’ll be surrounded by monotony but time will seem to stop for you and we found it incredibly romantic!   Hike the picturesque Plitvice Lakes and swim in the natural waterfalls at Krka National Park. Be sure to get to both parks right when they open to enjoy the beauty without the crowds!  Nice is home to a gorgeous coastline, cute restaurants, and a number of beautiful beaches. Take a walk along the boardwalk where you’ll find a variety of water activities. Our favorite was parasailing!   The “Honeymoon Island” of Greece, Santorini, is covered with white buildings that are accented by a blue paint that mimics the natural blue beauty of the surrounding sea. It’s a stunning and iconic view. Hike the volcano just off the west coast of Santorini with your loved one, or grab an ATV and explore the island’s surreal views.   How could we not include our second home and the birthplace of the Renaissance? There are numerous cooking classes offered to the public in Florence. We suggest booking a class that is offered out of the chef’s home.   Having fun as a couple is absolutely imperative.  If you’re stifled by stuffy dates and too much seriousness you’ll always be left wanting more. Playing, joking, and having a great time together are all such important aspects of a relationship. So what could be better than drinking beer, eating pretzels, and singing your hearts out to classic German drinking songs!? Not to mention the new friends you’ll make in the process.  Bali’s warm blue waters host some of the best surf breaks in the world. Most public beaches will offer very affordable board rentals and even lessons if you’ve never surfed before. There’s nothing more fun than playing in the water or learning something new with the one you love!       Hey y’all! We’re Michael and Alexandra Gallagher from Couple’s Coordinates! We provide TBA readers with couples travel tips, romantic getaways, travel guides, honeymoon suggestions, and anecdotes from our journey around the world together.

 Looks like you guys have been on some epic trips. My hubby and I love to travel and think that we can only continue this lifestyle if we decide not to have children. Is children something you will one day add to you traveling adventures or do you not want children , or think this would not be possible if you had children? Hi Stephanie! I’m not sure just yet, but I know it’s definitely possible to travel with children! I’ve met many people in the industry and while abroad who have introduced their kids to so many incredible places. Yes, it might be a different type of traveling than staying in hostels or luxury hotels—but it can be done! 🙂

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/ten-european-destinations-for-female-travelers/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  When it comes to European travel, there are certain places that are easier for travelers to get around, especially solo female travelers. Europe is a continent that is generally safe with low levels of crime, reliable transportation, and a respectful attitude towards women—but naturally, this can be felt more strongly in some places than others. Whether you are looking to go on a solo adventure or a trip with your girlfriends…  The spectacular scenery of Iceland makes for an amazing destination to explore nature—and when this is combined with a low crime rate, friendly locals, and developed tourist infrastructure, it makes it a great place for female travelers. A good range of day trips and attractions, such as the Blue Lagoon, the Golden Circle, glacier hiking, and diving at the Silfra Fissure, means you can either join organized trips or do things on your own!    
 With great levels of equality, clean and efficient transportation, and amazing sights to see, all of Scandinavia is ideal for female travelers, but Sweden is among the best with stunning cities such as Stockholm and Gothenburg. In the north of the country, you can find stunning views of the Northern Lights or you can pay a visit to one of the many islands that make up Sweden’s archipelagos.   There are plenty of historic attractions to be found in Portugal, along with some amazing winelands and stunning beach destinations! Portuguese food is so delicious, and the foodie scene walks such a fine line between tradition and innovation. I love the wine culture too, especially in cities like Porto. Lisbon is also a top destination for those looking for some retail therapy as it is home to a great range of independent fashion designers!  Italy is a beautiful country that has a balance of thriving culture and amazing cuisine, along with a distinguished history, unique culture, and really stunning sights to see. From exploring Rome to wine tasting your way through Florence, eating pizza in Naples, walking the canals of Venice, and driving the beautiful Amalfi Coast, female travelers will find no end to things to do in Italy! The country is welcoming and friendly, and even more so when you start to discover the excellent local wine and food!   The mountainous country of Switzerland in Central Europe has long been a popular tourist destination. Female travelers have their choice of adventures, ranging from the cosmopolitan city of Zurich, the picturesque streets of Geneva, and the old town of Bern. Plus, what girl doesn’t want to visit a country known for cheese and chocolate?!  Most people will naturally think of whiskey, Guinness, and lots of greenery when thinking of Ireland… but I think of warm and charismatic locals, beautiful winding roads, stunning natural scenery (and some whiskey and beer too!). There are no shortages of hidden gems around this country. From the beautiful architecture and lively scene of Dublin out to the rugged terrain on the Wild Atlantic Way, this is a great country to explore that is generally safe and friendly for female travelers. I did a Two-Week Ireland Road Trip with girlfriends and it was an absolute blast!  If you are looking to travel on a budget, Croatia is generally cheaper than many European countries, while still being a super friendly, easy-going, and safe place to visit.  It’s one of my all-time favorite destinations! The wonderful coastline means there are plenty of beautiful beaches and seafood-rich cuisine, along with great sailing and sunset cocktails. Come hungry and indulge in farm-to-table dishes, plus local truffles, honey, wine, and olive oil!   Famous for the canals of Amsterdam, tulip fields, windmills, and a history of artists, the Netherlands has a population that is welcoming for all female travelers. The flat terrain makes it great for outdoor sports such as cycling and hiking, and there are epic sights steeped in a rich history and Dutch culture throughout the country.  Where stunning ruins, volcanic cliffs, and friendly locals meet the sparkling blue Mediterranean Sea. My first trip to Greece was a summer adventure through Athens and Mykonos. I returned again to sail the Saronic Islands on The Yacht Week Greece, and then again to explore the Cyclades islands of Santorini, Milos, and Naxos! The laid-back culture is great for those who want to soak in some sunshine and ultra-fresh food.   This charming country has a wealth of history throughout its cities, and excellent transport connections sitting in the heart of Western Europe, making it ideal to include as part of a longer European adventure. Brussels is home to some wonderful architecture, the European Parliament, and the major EDM festival ‘Tomorrowland’, while cities like Ghent and Bruges offer walks along romantic canals (complete with white swans)! Sightseeing aside, Belgium is also famous for its chocolate, waffles, frites, and beer!

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/6-ways-spend-less-travel/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  From students to parents to busy professionals, there are always reasons that people feel they can’t make their globetrotting dreams come true, and it usually is because of the price tag. While travel does involve costs– airfare, accommodation and some activities– there are many alternative ways to travel that not only save money but allow you to have new experiences and follow your wanderlust. In fact, depending on your destination, you might even spend less seeing the world than you do staying in your own neck of the woods. Here are 6 ways to spend less on travel that’ll change everything! 
 In the summer, most destinations are at their most expensive. If it’s possible to travel in the off-season, do it! Places like Europe are perfect in the so-called “shoulder season” (April through mid-June and September through October). The weather is better, places are less crowded, and you’ll save a lot of cash. Knowing how to find cheap plane tickets is an art at any time of year. The number one strategy is to be patient. Finding a good price means you’ll have to do some serious searching. If you’re debating the best way to travel, check out the Rome2 Rio website. It’ll compare bus, train, air, ferry, and rideshare options so you can decide what makes the most sense for your trip. Keep in mind that sometimes combining transportation (for example, plane and train) can often be the cheapest pick. For ground travel, look into multi-way passes. Europe has some great deals that’ll let you see the continent on the cheap. Look into Interflix Euro Bus Pass and the Eurail pass for some bargains that will cure your wanderlust. HELPFUL TIP: If you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card, I recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase. Some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels. Plus, many cards offer additional points when making travel-related purchases. Some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card. My personal favorite is the Chase Sapphire Reserve (for frequent travelers) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred (if you’re just starting out)! Check out my favorite travel reward credit cards!    I love Airbnb—you’ll typically find accommodation cheaper than a hotel (and you can nab this Airbnb discount from me!). It’s even more budget-friendly if you get a place where you can use the kitchen to cook in! You can also check out HomeExchange, Homestay.com and VRBO for more great places where you can truly live like a local and explore amazing neighborhoods. Consider hostels as well, and keep in mind that many do offer private rooms! Check out my post on the truth about staying in a hostel if you’re debating whether the experience is right for you. If you want to stay in a hotel, look for ones that are located a little farther from the city center as they are usually cheaper. 
 Taxis can tend to get expensive so I try to use Uber whenever it’s available. Metros are often the best way to travel, and I recommend going underground for travel in almost any major city. Google Maps has a public transit option that works in most cities. Just type in where you want to go and it will tell you exactly which lines and busses you need to take to get there! A lot of big cities also have cheap and easy bike rentals that allow pick up and return around the city. Be sure to search for these bike share programs while you’re abroad. 
 The way you organize your daily activities can make or break your budget. Some of my best memories have actually been on adventures that didn’t cost a dime!   Forget overpriced touristy restaurants. The best way to try authentic grub is on a shoestring budget!   There’s nothing like treating yourself to some retail therapy while you’re away, but there’s definitely a right way and a not-so-cost-effective way.

 This article is packed with practical tips for saving on travel! I especially love the idea of traveling off-season – it not only helps cut down on costs but also makes for a much more peaceful experience. Booking flights in advance and using fare comparison tools are game-changers too. I’ve saved so much money in the past by following these strategies. I also appreciate the reminder to stay flexible with travel dates; sometimes shifting a trip by just a day or two can lead to huge savings. Thanks for sharing these helpful insights!

BlondeAbroad,https://www.theblondeabroad.com/best-travel-products-for-babies-and-kids/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  Our little one will be here in June! Meyer and I are well aware that our schedules will be thrown for a whirlwind. However, we will be starting our little one young and planning to take them on many travel adventures. Over the years, I’ve found the best travel gear for myself — from the best travel bags and luggage to the best carry-on items to my travel photography gear. So, it should come as no surprise that the minute I found out we were expecting, I started researching all the best baby travel products. From a baby travel bed to a travel bassinet for baby to travel-size baby products and even the best travel products for kids, I’ve found the best of the best! You can find a full rundown of my baby registry here, as well as the best smart gadgets for your baby!  I could write an entire blog post on this because there’s a lot to consider when dubbing a single stroller the “best” for travel. After tons of research, I’ve narrowed it down to my top three travel strollers—each with pros and things to consider! This is my personal favorite travel stroller! It’s great for tall parents, lies completely flat for napping on the go, folds into a hand-luggage-compliant size, and is sturdy while still being lightweight. Less expensive than most travel strollers. High-quality materials. Super durable—handled 6 weeks of cobblestone streets in Europe like a champ. Built-in newborn nest (no add-on bassinet needed). Adjustable tall handlebar for parents. Completely lie-flat seat for naps. Not the lightest option at 18 lbs. Is not a great option if you need to use it with an infant car seat — you have to remove the entire stroller seat. Not a one-hand open and close. Doona is the world’s first complete and fully integrated travel system, allowing you to move from car seat to stroller in seconds. Many of my friends SWEAR by the Doona and use it exclusively as their primary car seat and stroller. All-in-one car seat and stroller design, includes LATCH base for effortless use in your car, 17.2 lbs (more lightweight than traveling with a separate car seat and stroller) Pricey, rear-facing only (until the infant is 28.6 lbs or 32 inches), so can only be used for infants until they’ve outgrown it. The YOYO² is my favorite travel stroller if you want the lightest possible option and money isn’t an object. You can use it from newborn to toddler. The YOYO² stroller folds and unfolds in a moment, can be worn over the shoulder, and tucks in anywhere. It folds to cabin bagage dimensions, even with its newborn pack. Newborn to toddler design (with add-ons), folds to cabin baggage dimensions, includes padded strap and can be worn over the shoulder, only 13.6 lbs (14.5 lbs with newborn pack), can be used with car seats using an adapter. Pricey. Newborn set and accessories are sold separately. Non-adjustable handlebar. For someone who is always on the go, it is super important for me to have something that is not only wireless but portable. Willow can go with you any time and you have the option to pump directly into a bag if you aren’t using it right away. You can also use a pourable bag, which is ideal for preventing messy spills. Use code “TBA25” for $25 off! This convertible travel crib can be used as a crib or bassinet. It folds up small enough to fit in a backpack and only weighs 15 pounds making it perfect for travel.  This monitor is really cool because it is an all-in-one camera that has hassle-free mounting. It works with your phone as a monitor and has smart technology. It will track a bunch of things like sleep, temperature, and humidity. This has a travel adapter so you have the option to take it with you on the road. This has been recommended to me time and time again. I love that you can use it in the nursery or you can bring it with you wherever you’re going—it can even attach to a car seat. You’ll often see inexpensive mirrors for cars in registries, which work. But, in terms of safety, I prefer a camera so I don’t have to look back. I’d much rather keep my eyes on the road and have a monitor showing the baby at all times. It also has night vision, so if you’re driving in the dark, you don’t have to worry about not seeing your little one. I love that it’s portable and wireless, so it’s not just for the car.  There aren’t a ton of ways to heat up a baby bottle on the go, so I love that this is a cordless, battery-operated device. It has adapters so it works with different types of bottles. You can heat up a bottle on the plane or in the car, and even adjust the temperature for formula or breast milk. It’s a really nifty gadget to keep in your diaper bag! This travel bottle drying rack is small but enough space for lots of baby bottles, nipples, pacifiers, and pump parts! A portable UV sterilizer for pacifiers is 100% a necessity in my mind. It always freaks me out how often babies throw their pacifiers out of strollers and onto the ground. This sanitizes in 60 seconds! It has a chargeable battery with over 100 uses on a full charge. It also comes on a key chain to keep it handy on your diaper bag. One note is that you cannot use UV on natural rubber, but it’s fine for silicone pacifiers. This all-in-one baby carrier is made to grow with your little one from week 1 to 48 months. I love that it’s has a lot of cute designs and fashion-forward options. If price is an issue, another great option is the Ergobaby Omni 360. This comfortable carrier is soft and wraps around without all the complexity. Clip at your waist, put your arms through the straps, tuck your little one in, and you’re good to go! It’s designed for 4-month-olds to two years of age. Use “KIKI20” for 20% off the entire site! I love how BEIS paired functionality with a stylish aesthetic! We opted for the ultimate diaper pack as it’s a bit bigger and more unisex, and since Meyer and I will both be wearing it, it just made the most sense! Use code “BLONDEABROAD” for 15% off! This lightweight and compact changing pad is ideal for diaper changes on the go. Made from 100% cotton, it’s cozy yet water repellent, keeping any messes manageable and easy to clean. Perfect for little ones and toddlers, this blackout privacy pod allows your babe to get a good night’s sleep anywhere (day or night). Its bottomless design is made to fit over a travel crib, mini-crib, or some toddler cots. Keep your little one safe from the sun. This infant car seat cover makes it easy to protect babies from 99% of UV. It’s also great for protecting from wind, drizzle, chill, and bright lights. This may just be the cutest suitcase, EVER! Elli Ella’s kid-size luggage comes in a variety of colors (they even have a floral print). It can be wheeled (to and from airport gates, at the train station, or around the house). It has a retractable handle and a built-in elastic band so your little one’s favorite plush toy can come along for the ride. This is the coolest! This bundle includes 2 travel essentials in one box: a “BedBox” and the cutest backpack. The BedBox essentially turns an economy seat into a first-class seat (so cozy!), and the Crew BackPack expands for travels big and small. This is genius! Imagine a stress-free flight with your little one. The Flyaway Kids Bed creates a comfortable place for them to sleep and play on planes. It inflates in 90 seconds and deflates in an instant. It can be wiped clean and packs into a handy carry bag. Countless parent-friends of mine have the Veer Cruiser and say they exclusively use this over a stroller! Living by the beach in San Diego, I know this is going to be essential for us! Looking to round out your baby’s gears? Here are the best smart baby gadgets for tech-loving parents!

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/best-photography-equipment-travel-blogging/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  Every day, I get questions about my travel gear and photography equipment for travel. I want to disclose that I am not a professional photographer but I do love sharing my travel experiences through beautiful photos, videos, and vlogs. Over the years I’ve tried a number of things, improved upon my photography and editing skills, and found some favorites along the way.   This camera is perfect if you’re just starting to dip your toes into photography and plan to shoot mostly on auto settings! I’ve been using the Fujifilm X-T30 for years and loved how easy it made capturing beautiful shots, especially while exploring on the go. The new X-T50 takes everything I loved about the X-T30 and steps it up with a better sensor, faster autofocus, and an even more user-friendly design. It’s still that gorgeous, vintage-inspired mirrorless camera that’s lightweight, compact, and discreet. If you’re ready to start experimenting with manual settings, the X-T50 makes it super simple to adjust aperture, shutter speed, and other functions. It also comes with an easy-to-use touchscreen and now features a brand new Film Simulation dial, so you can play with Fujifilm’s iconic color profiles with just a twist. More details on Fujifilm X-T50!   I currently shoot with the Fujifilm X-T4 and absolutely love it, it’s been my go-to travel camera for years. But if you’re looking for something even more powerful, the X-T5 is the next step up and packs some seriously impressive upgrades. The biggest change? The X-T5 features a new 40.2MP sensor, which means even sharper, more detailed images without adding bulk. It’s actually lighter and more compact than the X-T4, but still has that weather-resistant body and the signature external dials that make Fujifilm cameras so intuitive and fun to use. While the X-T4 has a vari-angle screen that’s great for video and vlogging (one of my favourite features), the X-T5 brings back the 3-way tilting screen, which many photographers prefer for stills. It also steps up with faster autofocus and better subject detection, so whether you’re photographing people, animals, or landscapes, it’s quick, accurate, and reliable. If you’re more focused on photography than video, the X-T5 is definitely worth considering. It offers pro-level performance in a compact body and is perfect for travel, content creation, and anyone ready to level up their camera game. More details on Fujifilm X-T5!  This is my favorite point and shoot camera for video! Inside its compact body the RX100 VII is packed with everything it takes to deliver gorgeous images. The 24–200 mm zoom lens is complemented by super-fast AF, new Real-time Tracking, and Real-time Eye AF, plus enhanced image stabilization and an external microphone jack for high-quality movie shooting. What makes it so awesome for vlogging is the preview screen’s tilt option of 180 Degree up and 45 Degree down, so you can always see your frame, even when you’re shooting yourself. You can check out some of the vlogs I’ve shot on the camera HERE! More details on the Sony RX100 VII Compact Camera! The new GoPro HERO Black perfect for on-the-go travel and outdoor adventures—it’s waterproof and more durable than ever. From shooting sunrise time lapses in Indonesia to diving deep into the Blue Hole off the coast of Belize, I don’t go anywhere without my GoPro, the 3-way Mount, and extra GoPro batteries. More details on the latest GoPro HERO! If an SLR camera isn’t in the budget for your next trip, snapping photos on your iPhone is a great alternative for taking travel photos. A smartphone is not only good for taking photos and editing apps but also as a WiFi remote for your camera!       More details on Apple Unlocked iPhone!    This 18-55mm lens is a small standard zoom, and the first lens I got for my Fujifilm X Series camera. In my opinion, it is the most versatile and affordable kit lens in the Fujifilm X Series and great for day-to-day shooting. It’s one of the most compact zoom lenses I’ve seen, making it perfect for travel.    In recent years, the Fujinon 16-55mm f/2.8 lens has become my new go-to over the 18-55mm for a few reasons—it has almost the same focal range as the 18-55, but has an extra 2mm (16-18mm) allowing for a slight wide-angle view (it captures just a bit more of the scene when fully zoomed out)!     Ever wanted to get an epic shot, but all the elements wouldn’t fit in the photo? You’ll need a wide-angle for that! Having a wide-angle lens is awesome for landscape shots or shooting indoors in tight spaces. I typically use it when I want to shoot a large building or monument or give something scale. If there’s not a lot of room to capture the entire scene, I’ll always switch to this lens.   There are two 35mm lenses in the X Series lineup, I prefer this model for its f/1.4 aperture. It is most useful for shooting images with a closer subject and shallow depth-of-field, and while working in low-light conditions.       Print Instax photos by sending images from your smartphones to the small, portable printer by using the free Instax Share app!     This bag fits your camera, a lens, and a few small personal items!  Remove the strap and the bag functions as a protective camera organizer inside of a larger bag.   The perfect tripod for stable video and travel photography.     For use with the X-T3 camera and shooting 4K video.     High-speed, UHS-I technology for a quick read and transfer speed.     Keep all of your memory cards organized in this portable, hard carrying case!   It is imperative to backup photos and videos, so I use this hard drive. It also automatically save photos from your social networks in cloud storage!   This mount can be used as a camera grip, extension arm or tripod for ultra versatility and a variety of shots with your GoPro.   Clamp your GoPro to objects ranging in size from 0.25” to 2” — great for extreme sports.    Be sure to protect your smartphone from water damage, but also capture underwater shots!   This 4-in-1 lens includes a Fisheye Lens, a wide-angle lens, a 10x and 15x macro lens, plus 2  lens caps!   Check out my favorite smartphone photo-editing apps + my ultimate guide to smartphone travel photography!    My years of solo-travel meant that I needed to learn how to travel light with camera equipment and develop professional editing skills for photos taken by others.

One of the most frequent questions I get is the following… While it depends on the type of trip – whether I’m doing a lot of walking on cobblestones through European streets, exploring a bit of outdoor terrain, or hiking through the backcountry – I’m particularly fond of a few brands of boots and shoes. Typically, all of my favorite shoes and boots come from the same few brands:  Let’s kick off with my favorite comfortable travel boots, perfect for winter weather and outdoor adventures. Here are some of the best boots for outdoor adventures.   These Sorel Ainsley Conquest boots are sold out in this color online, but the Sorel Hi-Line Lace-Up Cozy Hiker Booties in Canoe are similar! From pieces to prevent blisters to my favorite foldable water bottle to warm clothing, here's the ultimate hiking gear guide for women! This winter, I needed high-quality waterproof winter essentials for my travels! Here are my favorite winter styles from Backcountry. I travel with “stylish” leather boots more often than hiking boots. They’re perfect for city escapes and seasonal fall & winter travel.  While I’m traveling, I like to stick with shoes that can pair well with lots of different outfits—no need to overload my bag with kicks I’ll only be wearing once or twice. I also like to pack a pair of super comfy sneakers for days when my feet really need some extra love (cobblestone streets of Europe where I’m walking 7+ miles a day, I’m looking at you). A few years ago, I learned about Kizik, and the Vegas and Lima are now my go-to everyday travel sneakers. They slide on completely hands-free—a total game-changer when I was pregnant and now that I have a little one!  Looking for sandals to complete all your outfits? Find my favorite sandals here! Do you have any favorite brands when it comes to shoes and boots? Super comfy kicks that I’ve simply got to sample? Let me know in the comments below! From slides to espadrilles to wraparound ankle designs, I'm all about comfort while still looking chic. Polish off the outfit with any one of these stylin' sandals. Here are my favorite styles for summer! Not sure what to pack for your next trip? I've put together packing guides and outfit inspiration for everything from tropical vacations to multi-day treks!

 Awesome list! Quick question which boots are the ones In the the bridge over look with the shearling on the edge Hey Cindy! They’re the Frye Samantha Hiker Boots – you can find them here. 🙂 What are the boots in the pic of you sitting in the camper with a coffee mug on your knee? Love them all but those are my faves. Hi Ashley! They’re a few years old so it’s really difficult to find those exact ones. But they are the Ainsley by Sorel, you can sometimes find them here – but sizing is VERY limited: https://rstyle.me/+UZxwu2vsXtTd-ZrB4Z2jGw

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-solo-female-travel/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  Updated: February 2023 Over the years, I’ve featured dozens of travel tips and destination guides on solo travel for women, but I wanted to put together a comprehensive female travel resource for everyone. Whether you are a first-time solo traveler looking for that extra push to take their first trip or a seasoned solo traveler… I firmly believe that solo travel for women is one of the best ways to learn about yourself and the world. Taking a solo trip is a fantastic way to grow. And when it comes to the best solo travel destinations, there are so many choices! Solo travel for women can be challenging — I’ve learned so much over the years (and I’m continually learning!). I put together this comprehensive guide to solo travel destinations and taking solo trips so you can better prepare for your next trip! 
 Research before you go—weather, local customs, dress codes, etiquette, etc. Make sure you know the basics of what to expect before you step off the plane. You’ll make better choices and get the most out of your trip. Is it your first time traveling solo? The most important thing to take with you is common sense. Always book your first night’s accommodation regardless—you’ll rest easy knowing you won’t have to deal with finding a hotel late at night or while jet-lagged. And always have a backup plan. Keep the address to your hotel handy (not somewhere that you need WiFi to access) and carry your passport with some extra cash in a well-concealed spot. Lastly, don’t forget your travel insurance! I HIGHLY recommend World Nomads. 
 One of the most difficult conversations that you can have in the build-up to your first solo trip is explaining to your loved ones what you are planning to do, and dealing with their reactions to the idea of solo travel. Some people understand it better than others! It’s common for those that care about us to be concerned with a solo trip, especially your first one. This concern is not limited to parents, but spouses, siblings, and friends may all have reasons to be worried about you traveling solo. Solo travel is an amazing and exciting adventure for many people and can be empowering and life-changing, but if your loved ones are likely to try and talk you out of it or maybe upset about your choice, it might be worth planning out the conversation beforehand to try and keep things on track. I always make sure to have a high speed data plan wherever I go—especially when traveling solo. I personally recommend Holafly eSIM. You get unlimited data to stay connected and have access to Google maps and translation apps!
Holafly provides reliable connectivity in more than 160 destinations worldwide with 5g speeds.

Learn more here and use my code THEBLONDEABROAD for 5% off!    The world is a magical, challenging, and fascinating place. Don’t be intimidated by it! Travel is all about breaking out of your comfort zone and growing beyond your own self-set boundaries. Don’t let your fears of safety, thoughts of being lonely, or concerns of getting stranded stop you from discovering yourself and the world. Go even if you aren’t sure—travel can expand your perspective and empower your sense of self. You won’t regret it. So grab the adventure by the reigns, and ride on!  Nine times out of ten, you’ll stuff your luggage with items that end up never seeing the light of day. And having a ton of luggage or a heavy backpack can put a damper on your travels. Avoid overpacking with a few standard tips:  Follow your wanderlust—just make sure it’s a safe destination, or know what to expect before you go. The first step would be to pick a city or region that has low crime and is considered “safe” for female travel. You’ll be able to relax and enjoy your trip better if you don’t have to worry about violence or muggings. Start by knowing yourself. If you can’t handle unwanted attention from men, book tickets to places that are more female-friendly.  Staying smart on the plane is the key to staying sane. If you’re cramped up for hours with blasting A/C, it can take a toll on your health. Pack a few refreshing items—a hairbrush, toothbrush, travel-sized deodorant, and breath mints. Be sure to pack some things that will keep you entertained on the flight too. I’ve outlined everything you need to stay comfortable in my Ultimate Carry-On Packing Guide! It’s the little things that do wonders to pick up your mood. Stay hydrated—drink water and avoid coffee and alcohol while on the plane. Wear loose-fitting leggings and slip-on shoes to stay comfortable and keep your circulation flowing.  Let’s face it—travel creates some obstacles to your fitness routine. Traveling with extra workout clothes and equipment isn’t always an option, and who has time for the gym when there’s a foreign cobblestone street calling your name? But keeping fit on the go doesn’t have to be a chore. I’ve compiled some awesome exercise essentials, tips for keeping a balanced diet, and how-tos on resetting your sleep schedule after long travel days! 
 Solo travel gives as much as you put into it. Be confident, smart, and informed—you’ll find the destination blooms right before you. Be safe—use your basic street smarts, be assertive, and keep your valuables close and hidden. But don’t forget to enjoy yourself. Open up, be warm and friendly, and get to know the locals. A smile can go a long way in helping you meet fascinating people and like-minded travelers.  Solo travel for women can be challenging — I’ve learned so much over the years (and I’m continually learning!). I put together this comprehensive guide to solo travel destinations and taking solo trips so you can better prepare for your next trip!

 I love this post – solo travel truly is transformative, and every single female friend who has solo travelled has gained so much perspective and independence. I went on my first solo trip at 17 and never looked back. I owe a lot of my personality traits to solo travel. I absolutely loved this guide! As someone who is considering my first solo trip, your tips on safety and packing were super helpful. The personal anecdotes made it feel relatable and inspiring. Can’t wait to put this advice into action on my next adventure!

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-travel-the-world-for-free/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  Got that travel bug biting away at all your thoughts? Can’t go a day without wanderlust poking its way into your agenda? If you constantly find yourself daydreaming and thinking of your next great escape, maybe you should just stop thinking about it and put some plans into action. For anyone thinking, “Ya right. I can’t afford to travel.”, this article is for you! The reason you might think time away is going to cost a fortune is because hotels, car rentals and activities come with a price tag. But, there are many alternative ways to travel that not only save money but allow you to engage with local communities and people in ways that will absolutely immerse you in a whole new culture and outlook on life. Plane tickets cost money, sure, but adventure and spirit-filled happiness is priceless. The following programs and websites offer some totally awesome ways to help lower your expenses and, essentially, travel the world for free.   Websites like Work Away list hosts in all different countries around the world that let you stay with them in exchange for a few hours volunteering throughout the week. Okay, you pay a signup fee for this website, but it’s like 10 euros. Considering you’d struggle to get a hostel for a night for that price, and here you get access to all these hosts for two years. It’s a no-brainer!  One of the better-known free methods of travel is Couch Surfing where you can host or stay with people around the world. People likely to host you couch surfing are travelers themselves who know what it’s like to be on the road. Some people may be worried about their safety when staying with a stranger, but use your best judgement and have some trust in fellow humans.   Put on your responsible hat and take care of someone’s house, pets and gardens while they’re away. Websites like HomeExchange and Mind My House help play matchmaker for homeowners and home “watchers” around the world. Again, there’s a small annual fee but, for long-term sitting, you’d be paying pennies per day to live in an amazing property! Hello, month-long accommodation!  While this is something that mostly benefits American travelers, credit card rewards programs offer benefits for everything from free fine dining to free hotel stays to free international flights. While it can take some serious research and a bit of a mastery of rewards programs, travel hacking can help you use rewards points wisely and ultimately travel for free. HELPFUL TIP: If you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card, I recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase. Some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels. Plus, many cards offer additional points when making travel-related purchases. Some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card. My personal favorite is the Chase Sapphire Reserve (for frequent travelers) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred (if you’re just starting out)! Check out my favorite travel reward credit cards!    WWOOF stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms where travelers can live and work on a farm in exchange for free meals and accommodation. It’s a great opportunity learn about a local culture, learn something new and get outdoors. Simply pick a destination and see what opportunities are available!  Same as with couch surfing, it’s time to trust in mankind! Western European countries like France and Spain have a great reputation for hitchhiking, as well as places like New Zealand, and people will get you places safely. Use your best judgment and use helpful resources for hitchhiking tips and information on how to get started. For women, hitch-hiking will always have an element of risk, so never go alone.   There are so many ways to teach English all over the world where you actually get paid to travel! The beauty of a TEFL certification is that once you have that certificate, you can teach ANYWHERE! TEFLPros is an award-winning online certification course for anyone who is looking to teach English abroad or online and begin a life of teaching, learning and traveling to places that you can only dream of. TEFLPros is woman-owned and operated by a teacher trainer who understands all the ups and downs of what it’s like to follow this path TEFL certification is a requirement for most reputable schools and the TEFLPros course will not only make sure you are fully prepared to teach but also provides lifetime job assistance for all grads.  Working at a recreational camp in Europe or the Americas is not only super fun but will save you so much money. Some programs geared towards college students, like Camp Adventure, even earn you college credits. For the length of your contract, you typically receive a living stipend, plus all accommodation, meals and laundry are provided.   If you aren’t keen on sticking out a finger and waiting on the side of the road, use a car-sharing network like Bla Bla Car. It’s basically organized hitch-hiking that connects people who need to travel with drivers who have empty seats.  Do you have any tips on traveling for free?

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/the-best-luggage-bags-for-travel/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!    When you live out of a suitcase, good luggage is essential. From carry-ons to day bags and checked baggage, I’ve spent a lot of years curating the perfect collection. Travel is so much easier when you have the right kind of bag for the trip. And, of course, quality is key. You definitely don’t want your bag falling apart at the airport…or anytime when you’re in transit.  As travelers around the globe are dealing with way more lost and delayed luggage than ever before, I highly recommend investing in Apple Air Tags to be able to track the location of your items at all times. You can attach them to your keys, backpack, or camera bags, and even slip one into your checked luggage for flights!  Even the best suitcase doesn’t organize itself. To keep things sorted, you’ll need to grab a few add-ons, such as Veken packing cubes, clear pouches, and a good passport cover.  Oh, and don’t forget your luggage tag. A lot of luggage looks alike, so grab a tag that screams “that’s MINE!”. When it comes to carry-ons, it’s essential to have the right size bag. For travel within the United States, you can usually take a 22-inch tall carry-on bag. When you are outside of the United States, generally you will be restricted to a 21-inch carry-on. Since your space is restricted, you’ll want to find a bag that’s easy to organize and maximizes every inch. This smooth-rolling bag with a trolley handle that’s cushioned (YES! A beautiful feature, in my opinion), ensures that your hands won’t ever feel the stress of towing luggage.
It has a built-in weight indicator, so if it’s over the allotted capacity for airlines, the indicator will turn red. It’s expandable — meaning there’s a bit more room for souvenirs, and it’s got a brilliant organization system built-in.

 This smooth-rolling bag with a trolley handle that’s cushioned (YES! A beautiful feature, in my opinion), ensures that your hands won’t ever feel the stress of towing luggage. It has a built-in weight indicator, so if it’s over the allotted capacity for airlines, the indicator will turn red. It’s expandable — meaning there’s a bit more room for souvenirs, and it’s got a brilliant organization system built-in. And, one of my favorite parts: it’s stain-resistant! My bag got a few scuff and dirt marks during our last international flight and I was able to scrub them right off, good as new. I’ve tested a lot of luggage in my days and I’ve got to say I’m seriously impressed (and in love) with my Béis carry-on. I’ll share more about the matching large suitcase later on, but spoiler alert: they bundle together seamlessly so you’re not struggling through the airport! Looking for another option? Here are a few other great solutions: Timelessly chic and endlessly practical, the OG bag is the perfect companion. This bag has a detachable messenger strap and an ultra-handy back panel sleeve, which secures over luggage handles. Built to endure the harshest of environments, the Monos carry-on is scratch-resistant, super light, and comes with a TSA-compatible combination lock to ensure that all your belongings stay safe throughout your travels. Day bags are the perfect way to keep your belongings protected from pickpocketers all while still looking stylish!  When you’re traveling, you’ll want to upgrade your normal handbag to a day bag that can fit more, and that’s safe from pickpockets. It’s good to have a bag that can carry your camera and all of your daily essentials! Made with lush Italian leather, ONA The Bowery has room for a camera and one small lens. If you are looking to go small and stylish, this one is a must-have. Probably the swankiest camera bag you’ll ever see, the Lo & Sons Claremont crossbody leather bag will keep your SLR camera, an extra lens or two, wallet, and other essentials safe and sound while exploring. For a bit more space, The Brixton is perfect. It’ll hold a DSLR camera with three lenses and up to a 13″ laptop.  When it comes to checked bags, I opt for double-compartment luggage for optimal organization and space. Having different compartments to stash things makes it infinitely easier to know where everything is (and re-pack at the end of a trip). I mentioned above how much I love my Béis Carry-On — but I honestly think if you’re going to spring for new luggage… While, yes, the *aesthetic* is a serious selling point, this is actually about functionality, too! There are built-in straps to attach your carry-on to your large roller bag, and then you can attach a hat to your carry-on. Meaning you can manage all the luggage with one hand. GENIUS! Baggage claim is about to get chic! This smooth-rolling 29″ luggage holds everything you need. Backpacks are perfect for every travel scenario. Whether you’re going backpacking or looking to hold your photography gear, there’s a backpack.  When you have a ton of tech to haul, a good backpack is in order. For photoshoot days, I like to carry a bag that’ll hold my camera, lenses, drone, laptop, and more. With waxed canvas and high-quality leather, the ONA Monterey has a compartment for laptops up to 13 inches, space for up to 4-6 lenses, and room for 1-2 camera bodies. It’s very sturdy and made of durable materials that will last you years on the road! This bag will fit a DSLR camera, multiple lenses, a 15″ laptop, removable modular inserts, a tripod holder, and 2 accessory pockets. It also has a back luggage strap so you can attach it to your suitcase.  Are you going on a backpacking adventure? You’ll need something sturdy and lightweight to hold all your gear. Here are my top picks! This backpack has a light frame and soft, edgeless padded mesh that offers a breathable surface (and ventilation) and can support large loads. It makes it easy to stay organized for a few weeks. This is a great lightweight backpack for a shorter trip. It has a mesh back panel that allows ventilation and the mesh on the harness and hip belt reduce chafing on your long travel days! Do you have a favorite brand of luggage or bag for when you’re on the road? Please share it in the comments below!

BlondeAbroad,https://www.theblondeabroad.com/why-travel-is-the-best-form-of-self-care/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  There is nothing that soothes me and leaves me feeling more revitalized than exploring the world. While detoxing from social media and journaling are smart ways to better connect with yourself, my favorite form of self-care is travel. As we enter into the new decade, I’m sure you are with me in looking for ways to feel better and brighter. To make this your best year, I encourage you to go out and explore. Traveling is one of the most enlightening and fun forms of self-care. While solo travel isn’t everyone’s cup of tea—whatever opens up your mind and pushes your boundaries is just what the doctor ordered. Whether that means traveling with a friend, a significant other, or going alone, travel has so many psychological and emotional benefits.  Travel opens your eyes. It changes the way that you see the world as well as the way that you look at yourself. The world is such a diverse and magical place. Exploring far-flung destinations allows you to see and experience other cultures. For me, relating with people in different circumstances across the globe has made me more empathetic by giving me a better sense of what it’s like to live in someone else’s shoes. Seeing the world through someone else’s eyes and understanding what is important to them puts things in perspective. Many times, it has pushed me to reflect on my own problems and realize that they aren’t as insurmountable as they might feel. It is all too easy to live in a bubble, and traveling is sometimes just what you need to appreciate the things that you may take for granted back at home.  I have learned so much through the people that I’ve met around the world. Staying in hostels, hanging out in restaurants and cafes, and simply getting around on local transport are fantastic ways to meet other people. Open your mind to meeting all kinds of people. Ask about their lives. Hear what they have to say, where they’re from, and why they’re traveling. You can learn more than you might think. Before you go, here are a few tips that’ll make it easier to meet people as you travel.  Travel physically pushes you to get out of your comfort zone and break from routine.  Looking to shake things up and really see how you can grow? Hop on a plane and explore new terrain! When you’re having to navigate a foreign country or communicate in a place that doesn’t speak your mother tongue, you really open yourself up to learning experiences and just seeing how much you are capable of. That place up there? That’s Mt. Huashan in Xi’an, China—the world’s most dangerous trail. While you don’t have to do that hike to get out of your comfort zone, the moment that you pack your bags, things start to change. Everything is new and, often, things don’t go according to plan. Sure, it can be very challenging at times…and maybe downright frustrating with language barriers—but in the end, you learn so much about others and yourself. Let this new self-awareness propel you to explore your goals and figure out what direction you want to head next (both literally and metaphorically). First time abroad? Here is everything you need to know before your first trip overseas.  The constant buzz and glow of your phone can be draining. Put your phone on silent and maybe even turn it over to airplane mode sometimes so that you aren’t always distracted.
While taking pictures is a must when you are visiting somewhere new, I prefer to share my snapshots after the trip. Staying off social media allows me to truly embrace the present moment.
 The constant buzz and glow of your phone can be draining. Put your phone on silent and maybe even turn it over to airplane mode sometimes so that you aren’t always distracted. While taking pictures is a must when you are visiting somewhere new, I prefer to share my snapshots after the trip. Staying off social media allows me to truly embrace the present moment. Travel is the best way to escape your bubble. It’s easy to get caught up in the little problems of our daily lives, but once you take a step back you realize how small or insignificant those problems are in the grand scheme of themes. You get a break from FOMO and small-town drama. The world is so much bigger than your neighborhood!   When I get back from a trip, I find myself appreciating the little things in life. My bed feels just a bit cozier, and simple conveniences are just a dream. For instance, did you know that tampons are impossible to find in some places around the globe? Check out my post on traveling with Aunt Flo for more info! Getting into a rut is all too easy. We all go into autopilot sometimes. You know how it is—you go to and from work, sit in front of a screen at night, and then the days start to blur together. If you are feeling burnt out, now is the time to book a ticket and switch things up!  My personal form of “self-care” is specifically solo travel. Going it on your own means that you are literally spending all that time by yourself. When you are exploring on your own, you are the maker of decisions and the problem solver. Whatever obstacles and hurdles come up, you have to navigate them by yourself. But it’s not all hard work! It’s also a chance to completely indulge yourself. While it’s fantastic to be surrounded by people you love—maybe your friends don’t necessarily want to see the same movie you do, go to a new art museum, or try a certain restaurant. Solo travel makes you realize you can do everything you want to do. I dare you to take yourself on a date. Never underestimate the psychological and emotional benefits of giving yourself “me time,” along with a much-needed digital detox. Considering solo travel but feeling intimidated? Here are a few places that I found very welcoming to women traveling alone.  Travel can be the best form of self-care. It can heal a broken heart. It can help you reignite your passion. It can help you grow and become a more understanding person. How has travel helped you? Let me know in the comments below!

 I loved reading through your thought, and I completely agree with everything you wrote down. One, that traveling made me more understanding, caring, and open for other cultures, and people, in usual. The other is that nothing is recharging me better than traveling.  I found this out when I was 12 years old, running away every month 2 times to my grandfather – who was always busy and I didn’t know anyone in the town – where I met so many new people, by myself, and this started to expand as I was growing to cities, nearby countries, and in the end to the world. I already know that my “need a trip” button when it is turning on in my head, and I’m always prepared in advance with a trip booked for that period. There’s literally nothing better than solo traveling for self-care. I loved this post! xx Hey Helga! Thank you for sharing your thoughts. And I completely agree—in my opinion, traveling is one of the best ways to see the world and become more empathetic to other walks of life. I think it also shows us that while cultures may differ, there are so many similarities, too. I love this post! I love traveling because I feel so revived after going on a trip. Specially when I travel somewhere new. It’s like a reset button, it  gets my out of my head and my usual patterns. I believe it’s great for mental health too. It truly is one of the best form of self care out there. Hey Rica! I completely agree — it’s a great way to see what you’re capable of and also step out of your normal bubble and routine. 🙂

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-volunteer-travel/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures! w The idea of volunteering abroad or as part of a long term trip is something that appeals to many people. The combination of exploring a new destination and being able to help local people or causes is fulfilling and empowering. Volunteering isn’t always what those expect it to be, so it is important to do your research beforehand, to enter into a project with your eyes open and to have realistic expectations about what you can achieve and the type of results you can expect. For those who do their research and plan for something that suits them, as well as the organization they will be volunteering with, then it can be a wonderful and life-enhancing experience that is great for everyone involved.  Global Water Brigades in Honduras Although the idea of volunteering seems like a wholly good thing that will have a positive impact, it is important to research that the work you will be doing is ethical. Unfortunately, it’s become all too common that some organizations and non-profits bringing in Western ideas and volunteers to developing countries cause more hard than good. “One of the hardest things for new, eager volunteers to understand is that not all organizations—even non-profits—are doing good, necessary work that ethically develops the communities and eco-systems where we volunteer our time. For that reason, take a step back from the planning and instead learn more about core problems facing development projects when they bring in Western volunteers and ideas.” -Shannon O’Donnell, A Little Adrift The best projects are those that receive support from the local population. An organization should be working with the local community as opposed to trying to change things against their will. Consider how your volunteer work will support the area in which you are working and the kind of impact you volunteering there may have- both the direct impact and the indirect implications of you working in that area.  Epic Arts Center for disabled youth in Cambodia One of the challenges that people taking a volunteer travel trip may encounter is that the work itself may be quite different to what they were expecting. While many people think that volunteer travel can involve something quite exciting, such as diving to tag beautiful sea creatures with GPS trackers, the majority of volunteer projects will usually involve a lot of hard work. If you have never volunteered before, then it is usually worth starting to volunteer with a local project in your community before committing to international volunteer roles, just to be sure that it will be the right thing for you. There are countless types of volunteer opportunities, so identify what it is you would be most interested in. It is also important to look at the skills that you have to offer a volunteer organization, whether you speak another language, have medical experience or have a particular talent for construction. Then, think about how those skills can be applied in a volunteer role.  Volunteering with Biblioworks in Morado K’asa, Bolivia Picking the right organization that offers the right volunteer opportunity for you can often be a difficult choice, as not all organizations will offer the same support and the same experience. It’s important to be aware that there are situations in which some volunteer organizations are not always run purely for charitable reasons. If you are fundraising or have to pay for a fee for your volunteer opportunity, then it is important to know where the money is going and that the money ends up in the right place. It is also important to know how much total contribution you are expected to make, both in terms of the time you need to dedicate to the project and the money you will need to either raise or pay to the organization. As you are considering these aspects, it is also worth considering how much time you are willing to commit to your volunteering opportunity. Do you want to work 8-hour days, six days a week for the organization? Or, are you looking for a more balanced experience taking up a few hours, three or four times a week? The vital part of choosing the right volunteering experience is to do your research, make sure you are aware of the commitment you are making, and to see what others have said about the same volunteering work.  Give & Surf in Bocas del Toro, Panama One of the realities of being a volunteer is that all charities and organizations need funding. They will most likely ask you to either fundraise a certain amount before agreeing to your volunteer placement, or they will ask you to raise money while you are volunteering. This is because providing volunteers with accommodation, food, tools, health and safety equipment and everything else they need to do their work does cost money. If you are being asked to raise money or make a contribution before starting your volunteer placement, asking the organization about what this money will be used for is important. When it comes to fundraising, there are a variety of different platforms that can be helpful for receiving donations and keeping track of money raised. But, many charge fees of 5-10% to cover their expenses. The best and lowest cost online fundraising platform that I’ve found is You Caring, which has 0% fees. The only fees are from Paypal (typically, 2.9% + $.30) when donations are made by credit card or debit card. Once you have started work as a volunteer, keeping in touch with your donors is also a great way to let them know how their support has helped you to make a big difference for your chosen cause.   Depending on your skills, the type of experience you are looking for and your own interests, there are a variety of different volunteering opportunities available as you travel. Keep in mind, volunteering isn’t just about traveling abroad or getting your hands dirty either. Many non-profit organizations need administrative, fundraising, marketing and legal help more than anything, which people can volunteer their time from remotely. For those looking to volunteer their time and energy abroad, here are some examples of volunteer roles to explore: If you would like to travel but don’t have a lot of time to be able to offer, or are looking for a fun and rewarding experience, then volunteering for a particular event can be very exciting. Volunteering your time as staff for events such as charity concerts and charity fun runs can all help these organizations to raise money. There are also opportunities to volunteer at big sporting events. In 2012, I was a Team USA volunteer for the Paralympic Games in London. It was a fun, rewarding and unforgettable experience. For those who have a qualification in teaching or have experience in helping people to learn English as a second language with a TEFL certification, this can be put to good use by educational charities. TEFLPros is an award-winning online certification course for anyone who is looking to teach English abroad or online and begin a life of teaching, learning and traveling to places that you can only dream of. TEFLPros is woman-owned and operated by a teacher trainer who understands all the ups and downs of what it’s like to follow this path. TEFL certification is a requirement for most reputable schools and the TEFLPros course will not only make sure you are fully prepared to teach but also provides lifetime job assistance for all grads. Organizations, such as Room to Read, are dedicated to improving literacy around the world. I volunteered with Biblioworks in Bolivia and helped fundraise to host their first-ever book fair in the city of Sucre. I’ve also helped raise money for an orphanage in Peru called Peruvian Promise. The money we raised helped pay for three girls’ college educations. Literacy is one of the greatest tools we can give to people so that they can help themselves. Working in developing countries is one of the most common types of volunteer travel, and this can be for both skilled and unskilled volunteering. Those with medical qualifications such as dentists, doctors, and nurses are particularly valued, and can either help with general programs, or can be sent in as aid with organizations like Red Cross for medical emergencies like hurricanes and earthquakes. One of the biggest global issues is access to clean water and is something I highly consider supporting as your first international volunteer experience. Organizations like Global Water Brigades, where I volunteered in Honduras, help improve water quality and bring clean water access to developing parts of the world. These are often very desirable volunteering opportunities, and these can include working with injured or endangered animals such as at an elephant or lion sanctuary. There are also many projects that work to support the habitats of these animals, although it is particularly important to research the ethics of the organization you will be volunteering with before committing to the volunteer work.  Nurtured by Nature Otters & Animal Non-Profit in California There are several things to consider before you make the commitment to volunteer, especially if you intend to volunteer on a longer-term basis. If you are looking to be able to travel along with volunteering, make sure you choose a volunteering project that allows you the free time to do this. Many projects will expect you to be able to volunteer for similar hours to that of an employee working a normal week. It is also worth checking to see if the organization does insist on particularly long days or periods of extended work during your project. You should also find out what the accommodation arrangements will be, as some projects will offer hostel-style accommodation with food included, and others can be very basic. Knowing what to expect ahead of time will help ensure that you aren’t uncomfortable with the experience once the volunteer program begins. It is also important to be realistic in terms of what your work can achieve, as most projects will not see dramatic changes during a two-week or even a month-long volunteer stay. Many projects take several years to show their impact.  Peruvian Hearts in Cusco, Peru If you have read this guide, and are thinking about taking a trip that allows you to volunteer abroad, I’ve included some resources below for further information and inspiration. Volunteering will not be for everyone, but if you can find a suitable position that will allow you to volunteer for a period of time that you are comfortable with, then it can be a tremendously enriching experience for both yourself and those who you are helping.  Know you want to volunteer but not entirely sure in what way…or where? Check out GoEco—an organization that sets up trips for those that want to take a volunteer vacation. They operate in over 40 different countries with 150 programs—from working with wildlife to teaching English to kids, so you can go through and see what piques your interest.

 Hi,
I’m a decently well-seasoned traveler who has lived on a few continents. I also, am 35 and have only done volunteer work (in the US) for the last decade; while I was in university. I’m a retired, disabled veteran and am waiting on a Peace Corps assignment. I’m planning a few-month trip to Peru and am looking to spend the majority of the time volunteering/learning Spanish. I only have one working arm and am half-blind. I wondered if you had any advice or resources you think would be beneficial to me? The TEFL cert. It already seems like a big help. Hi Daniel! I’m not well-versed in the volunteering opportunities in Peru; my best advice would be to find places you’re interested in and inquire internally! I would imagine that each place is different and they will be able to provide you with much more specific advice as every volunteer opportunity/non-profit needs people with different skillsets!

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-make-money-while-traveling-long-term/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  When traveling the world on a limited budget, of course, the idea of earning money while traveling is going to cross your mind. Earning money while on the road will give you an opportunity to travel longer and experience more things along the way. With access to the Internet almost everywhere, it has become easier for travelers to earn money while seeing the world. Depending on your skills and how much time you are willing to give, it is not impossible for you to fund your travel expenses no matter how long you want to do it. As someone who left her high-paying corporate job, I couldn’t stand the fact that all of a sudden, my income would stop arriving in my bank account. I also realized that even though I would be traveling on a budget, it didn’t mean I should compromise my comfort. Rather, with comfort comes expenses. So, I decided to find ways where I could still work while doing what I loved most. This article is a starting block to consider the options you have for earning an income while traveling long-term.   Becoming a web developer is one of the best ways to earn online while traveling. These days, a lot of companies, both big and small, need websites and developer services. Most companies prefer to hire freelancers online as it is cheaper for them to do so. And, for a developer, you can earn major bucks or trade your services for free hotel stays and travel tours. These days, many long-term travelers fund their adventures through this online profession.  Writing for travel sites is one of the fastest ways to earn money on the road. Doing this will improve your writing skills and help you have a better perception of the country you are traveling. Websites such as Matador Network are willing to pay from $25 to $50 for an article depending on the quality and the number of words. That is not a lot but still, it is something, right? On top of this, a lot more people will get to read about your travel experience.   Since you’re leaving your home or apartment to travel, you should consider listing the space on Airbnb and making some money to support your travels! Becoming an Airbnb host is simple and it can seriously pay off. Just check out this calculator to figure out how much you can earn. When you’re away, you can list your entire place to cover the cost of your own travel accommodation, and sometimes even more! Serving as an Airbnb host is quite flexible; you can offer a couch, room, or your entire place if you wish. I understand that it can be worrying to have strangers in your home when you’re away, but Airbnb strives to mitigate any worries. All of the guests are vetted and they have liability claims of up to $1 million USD available.    Businesses and brands around the world are always in need of logos, web design, or other design elements for their companies. Becoming a graphic designer, or continuing to use your graphic design skills, on the road is a great profession and can be performed from anywhere in the world! You could also create your own designs, templates, and prints, and list them for sale on sites like Etsy, Society6, and Creative Market!   With enough time and effort, you can earn an income from a blog. However, unlike writing articles for other websites, starting your own website requires a bigger investment of both time and money. But, if you are consistent and are able to grow your audience, you can earn an income. Many successful blogs get at least $1,000 on a monthly basis through ad revenue, sponsored content, and online sales.  Many people who have online stores start them before they start traveling. You don’t even need to start your own website to start selling! There are websites like Etsy and Society6 that you can use to create your own store and promote your products or digital downloads. In fact, get 40 FREE listings on Etsy by signing up here. If you can’t manage an inventory while on the road, you can also consider affiliate sales on your own website. Affiliate products are items sold by a third party that you earn a commission on for marketing. For example, you feature a $100 camera sold on Amazon on your website. You make a sale and Amazon pays you $6 in commission. Most affiliate programs pay out between 4-12%, so you’ll need a large audience to earn a significant income.   If you’re into photography or videography, it’s definitely a dream to shoot around the world. And, there are a lot of individuals and companies looking for talented photographers. Consider offering your services for weddings, other travelers, and companies in the destinations you are traveling. Video can bring in some major bucks if you are good at marketing yourself and securing clients. You can also put up your photographs and video clips on stock websites like Shutterstock and get paid for every download. It’s advisable to build out an expansive library and to learn a thing or two about keyword searches and SEO before you go this route, but you can earn a lot of passive income.  If you are fluent in English, then you have a great opportunity to travel while earning money at the same time. There are a lot of non-English speaking countries, especially in Asia, that are willing to pay a lot for teachers. To get started, the best thing you have to do is to get accredited with online resources. TEFLPros is an award-winning online certification course for anyone who is looking to teach English abroad or online and begin a life of teaching, learning, and traveling to places that you can only dream of. TEFLPros is women-owned and operated by two teacher trainers who understand all the ups and downs of what it’s like to follow this path. TEFL certification is a requirement for most reputable schools and the TEFLPros course will not only make sure you are fully prepared to teach but also provides lifetime job assistance for all grads. This is more of a long-term option, but if you love it and become successful at it, making it a career is also possible. Being a short-term tutor is, of course, also an option. The most common countries that will need your service include China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan.   Many people normally overlook this one. A lot of travelers leave their comfort zone with the money they spent years saving without considering that they might already have the skills to earn money on the road. Some of the other skills you can offer while traveling includes hairstyling, massage, surfing, yoga, customer services, cooking, and others.   The idea of working while traveling has been developed over time. Before, the thought of earning was severely related to business travel, but now, you can travel while running your own business! But, of course, it’s not always as easy as it may seem. Here are some things to consider before living the dream of earning money while traveling: First of all, you need to know what you really want and what suits you best– do you prefer spending part of your day sitting in front of the computer, or would you rather do something physical? Technology has made it possible to sit anywhere in the world while earning money. There are a lot of ideas you can consider like the ones mentioned above, but there are also jobs that don’t require you to be connected all the time. Do you like being in the water? Work as a lifeguard. Do you like boats? Become a yacht stewardess. Do you like the party scene? Practice your bartending. Do you like kids? Work as a tutor! Browse more travel jobs here. Are you planning to work while traveling because you are running out of travel funds, or do you simply want to keep adding to your funds? Knowing the purpose as to why you are working on the road will help you choose which job suits you best. With many options to earn money while traveling through online resources, it is very important to be careful with the websites you’re using. You’ll find both free and pre-paid websites, so I would recommend only dealing with websites that don’t require or only require a minimal fee. For example, if you’d like to do freelance writing, some of the most trusted websites are Upwork, PeoplePerHour, and 99designs. Again, earning money online is not easy for everyone. The job needs to match your interests, talent, and abilities. You have to be realistic when choosing the job you want to do on the road.

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/10-safest-destinations-solo-female-travelers/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  I’ve written countless articles on solo travel for women and why every woman should venture out on her own. But, I’m often asked, “Where is it safe for women to travel solo? Where should I go on solo trips?” While there may be some destinations that are safer than others, the world is not as scary as some might think. With a positive attitude and general street smarts, there are plenty of safe places to travel alone where you can feel confident and secure on your own. In my opinion, these are the best destinations to travel solo! Note: Please keep in mind that “safe” is a relative term and you should always use your best judgment when on a solo trip. These recommendations are based on my own experiences and my sense of safety traveling solo to each destination.  If there’s one country perfect for solo female travelers — it’s Iceland. The small Nordic island nation is one of the safest countries in the world, it’s easy to get around and is full of incredible adventures – perfect for your first-ever solo trip! Even though Iceland’s nickname of “The Land of Fire & Ice” sounds intimidating, solo travel is comfortable and easy here. The city of Reykjavik is famous for its music scene and nightlife, so you’ll have no problem meeting locals and fellow travelers. There are countless reasons to visit Iceland, but it’s her natural beauty that steals the show. Join a tour and snorkel or dive the Silfra Fissure, or even hike a glacier in Iceland! And don’t miss a bath at the beautiful Blue Lagoon! As one of the safest places for solo female travelers, Iceland is an ideal pick! Here are 10 tips for traveling around Iceland!   From the drop-dead gorgeous mountain views, meadows on meadows of beautiful wildflowers, and the Rhône river backdrops, Switzerland is one of the most picturesque countries. If you’re visiting Switzerland in the winter, the Swiss Alps and Interlaken are a must. If you’re interested in looking at stunning architecture all day, Bern gets an honorable mention for being so dang beautiful. Geneva was one of my favorite spots on a summer jaunt around Europe—with access to the lakeshore, the jet d’eau, Parc de la Grange, and more, it’s the perfect spot to be immersed in the Swiss culture. Switzerland is in the top 10 of the safest countries in the world. While violent crime is extremely rare, petty crime such as pickpocketing and theft of vehicles (including bikes) does occasionally happen in the bigger cities. Adventure awaits in the glaciers, beaches, and fjords of New Zealand. In New Zealand, you’ll come across some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. New Zealand is one of the easiest places to travel alone as a woman. The country has excellent infrastructure, it’s safe and the perfect choice if you love the outdoors and adventure sports. If you’re looking to meet other travelers, join an adventure tour or stay in one of the many hostels. For those looking to get away from the world for a bit, you can rent a motorhome and go on a self-driving tour of the country. Doing a New Zealand road trip is an extremely popular way to see the gorgeous country and all it has to offer. Just keep in mind that a trip to New Zealand can get pricey — so budget more than you think you’ll need. Here are my tips for traveling New Zealand on a budget! Australia is home to some of the most diverse wildlife and landscapes in the world, and it was the destination of my first-ever solo trip abroad — now that’s saying something! Plus, Americans can get a working holiday visa! You should also explore the bigger cities of Sydney, Melbourne, and the stunning Gold Coast, but don’t limit yourself—rent a car and hit the road. Because English is the common language in Australia, it makes getting around very easy for native speakers, too! Nearly everywhere you go in Canada; you’ll be surrounded by multiculturalism and some of the most breathtaking landscapes your eyes have ever seen. Canadians have a reputation for being the friendliest people in the world and, while traveling alone here, you’ll see why! Canada is also massive, and there are tons of hiking trails and other outdoor activities for adventure junkies at the various national parks. Make your way to the West Coast and stop by Vancouver—the bustling seaport is home to a thriving art, music, and theater scene. For something completely different, visit the city of Montreal. Placed on an island in the Saint Lawrence River, its narrow streets are lined with cute boutiques and bistros, and you can soak up the city’s unique French colonial heritage. Solo travel for women sounds pretty great in Canada, hey?    With diverse marine life, some of the world’s best diving, incredible natural beauty, and a heavy vanilla scent that follows you wherever you go, the islands of French Polynesia are a place that you’ve never seen the likes of before. It is truly SO breathtaking and a memorable destination that you’ll want to return to year after year. While getting there is one of the most difficult parts, French Polynesia is an excellent safe place to travel alone. Ireland may not be known for great weather, but the Emerald Isle is a place of happiness and beer. Cozy up in a local pub, catch a football game, or head out to the countryside for an incredible Irish experience. There is so much to see and do in the gorgeous green country — here are tips for exploring Ireland! Whether you’re looking to road trip around Ireland, experience the top things to do in Dublin, visit the Guinness Storehouse, or traverse the Wild Atlantic Way, there is no shortage of fun things to do. Is Ireland on your solo travel bucket list? For those who are backpacking around Europe, it’s a fantastic solo travel destination in Europe!   Namibia is the ultimate road trip destination and a fantastic destination year-round. Home to deserts and stunning coastlines, it’s one of my favorite trips to Africa to date. Located in the largest conservation area of Africa, Sossusvlei is breathtaking. On my first trip to Namibia, I spent seven epic days road-tripping in Namibia. For my second trip, I explored the Skeleton Coast and stayed at Spitzkoppen Lodge! Want to travel to a destination that’s completely different from your hometown? Book a ticket to Japan! With its fascinating Japanese culture, a trip to the Land of the Rising Sun is an incredible experience. Tokyo is generally a safe city to explore for solo female travelers, and you can get pretty much everywhere with the city’s efficient train system. Plus, there are female-only train cabins, and some hotels have female-only floors! Spend your trip belting out tunes at karaoke, eating your way through the best food in Tokyo, or exploring the famous Harajuku district. If you’re a major foodie like me, you’ll definitely want to sample these local Japanese foods. Whether you want to stick to Tokyo or explore other parts of Japan like Kyoto, Osaka, or Mt. Fuji — there is so much to see and do. Here are 10 tips for traveling around Japan!  Dubai is unlike any other city on the planet. With its bold architecture and over-the-top style, the United Arab Emirates’ largest city is a distinct fusion of its Bedouin heritage and an ultra-modern culture all its own. Dubai doesn’t just live up to its reputation; it will completely exceed your expectations. Explore the glitz and glam, and then uncover the ancient traditions of this multifaceted city. While traveling Dubai as a woman, and on a solo trip at that, might not be the first place on your radar — Dubai is a great solo travel destination! Violent crime is low, and tourists typically won’t face anything worse than some pickpocketing. If you’re a solo female traveler, two major things to keep in mind while in the UAE are how you act or dress in public to prevent breaking local rules. While this may seem odd, especially if you’re from a Western country, it’s a different culture, so read up before you head to any conservative country!   I host bespoke female tours around the world, including Morocco and South Africa.

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/why-you-should-be-traveling-with-reef-safe-sunscreen/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  While wearing sunscreen is extremely important to protect your skin, did you know that it can cause damage to our planet’s reefs?  When sunscreen washes off of your skin and mixes with the water, it can contribute to coral bleaching and even speed up the process. While many people aren’t familiar with coral bleaching, you’ve probably heard something along the lines of,  Well, it’s not just the Great Barrier Reef, but coral reefs around the world—places like Hawaii, Seychelles, and the Maldives—are impacted by the chemicals in some sunscreens.  Not only do the chemicals hurt the reefs but they can also be toxic for marine life. The culprits? Research has now found quite a few including: Oxybenzone, octinoxate, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Avobenzon, Octisalate and Parabens. In response, countries and regions are stepping up. Reef-harming sunscreen ingredients have now been banned or restricted in places like Hawaii, Palau, Aruba, Thailand (within marine parks), and Mexico. Because of the harm they can cause, many islanders are taking matters into their own hands and developing reef-safe sunscreens, in hopes of protecting their home. Want to make your environmental impact on the world less? From tips to how to make your life more ""green"" at home to sustainable practices and eco-friendly travel resources, here is the sustainability and eco-travel guide. We can all do something to reduce our carbon footprint while traveling. Here are my tips on how to reduce your environmental impact!  While climate change is one of the biggest factors impacting marine life, the sunscreen we use doesn’t have to add to that!  So what exactly is coral bleaching?  When the chemicals in sunscreen get into the water, they can cause damage to the DNA in larval and adult stage coral. But what does that mean? It limits their growth and ability to develop in a healthy way…essentially, coral can’t reproduce as it should. Yet, some studies suggest that oxybenzone can make coral more vulnerable to bleaching at lower temperatures than usual.
And with oceans heating up—this is huge! Think about when you get a fever…it’s only a few degrees higher than your normal body temp, but man oh man, can you feel it!
 Yet, some studies suggest that oxybenzone can make coral more vulnerable to bleaching at lower temperatures than usual. And with oceans heating up—this is huge! Think about when you get a fever…it’s only a few degrees higher than your normal body temp, but man oh man, can you feel it! As coral reefs are already struggling, we don’t want to add anything else that might harm them!  Your skin is your biggest organ, so you should be doing everything you can to help protect it, right?  Think about what happens when you use sunscreen: you reapply multiple times and allow it to soak into your skin. If you’re using a spray, you potentially inhale sunscreen fumes…or if you apply SPF to your lips, you could ingest a small amount. 
 The FDA is concerned that some sunscreens might include cancer-causing ingredients, be messing with hormones, and causing endocrine disruption. No thank you!
Sunscreens that also contain retinyl palmitate (aka vitamin A), which is an antioxidant that combats skin aging, may actually trigger the development of skin tumors when in the sun.
 The FDA is concerned that some sunscreens might include cancer-causing ingredients, be messing with hormones, and causing endocrine disruption. No thank you! Sunscreens that also contain retinyl palmitate (aka vitamin A), which is an antioxidant that combats skin aging, may actually trigger the development of skin tumors when in the sun.   Don’t worry, that doesn’t mean you need to stop wearing sunscreen—not at all! First, when looking to purchase a new sunscreen, lip products, and skin lotions, steer clear of ingredients like vitamin A—aka retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate, retinyl linoleate, and retinol. Second, avoid spray sunscreen.  When you spray the sunscreen, you’re not only getting it on youreslf but you’re also getting it all over your surroundings. You’re putting solutions into the air and all over the sand, potentially causing harm to even more critters and their habitats. And, last but not least, wear mineral sunscreens. They are typically made with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide; research shows that few (if any) zinc or titanium particles actually penetrate the skin. So, when it comes to sunscreens, mineral ones tend to be better than chemical, for both you and the environment. If using spray sunscreen is absolutely necessary, I recommend spraying yourself in the shower or spray into your hand to apply. This way you can contain it in an enclosed space. These are some of my favorite reef-friendly, water-resistant, and biodegradable sunscreens! Reef-safe, oxybenzone & octinoxate free Tested and proven reef-safe, biodegradable everyday sunscreen  Researching the ingredients in your sunscreen will not only help the environment, but it will also help you live your best, healthy life!  So take a peek at those ingredients and check out if the sunscreen you’re purchasing is reef-friendly, especially for your next tropical vacation!  If you want to ensure your lifestyle is more eco-friendly when you travel, I’ve compiled a guide on all the things you can start doing to be more “green.”

 Thanks for sharing! I just came back from snorkeling at a protected lagoon. There are additional ways to stay safe: — Wear a wide brimmed hat
— Wear sun protective clothing can go a long way with reducing the amount of sunscreen that you use and reapply often
— Wear swim leggings and swim long sleeve shirts
— Avoid sun during the peak hours (10 AM – 4 PM) It also appears that the term “reef safe” is not actually a marketing term, and it’s not approved by the FDA. Hi LC! Great ideas for avoiding too much sun exposure. And that’s really interesting about the “reef safe” term — I wonder if that will change in the months/years to come

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/why-solo-female-travel-isnt-safe/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  As female travelers, it’s important to look at the complexities of safety and what it really means to be “safe.” We often talk about safe solo travel destinations—where the best places are to go (as a gal) and what places are ideal to explore alone. But, things can get tricky once you are actually there. It is critical to understand that safety is not the same as comfort. Just because a place is “safe,” doesn’t mean you won’t encounter different cultural norms that make you uncomfortable. It also doesn’t mean that crime doesn’t happen. These ideas often get misconstrued and, while getting out of your comfort zone can be a really good thing, it can also be uncomfortable. Too often, I hear people talk about letting their guard down because they’ve heard a destination is “safe,” and then they are frustrated when they realize that things can still go wrong…especially when they encounter cultural norms much different from their own. The truth of the matter is you can be unsafe anywhere at any time. But, this doesn’t mean you should stop traveling or avoid going solo as a woman. What it does mean is that we need to come together for an open and honest conversation about travel safety.  What does it mean to feel safe? Does it mean that you’re 100% comfortable in your environment? Does it mean you’re not getting cat-called or harassed? Does it mean you don’t feel like you have to be on alert? Does it mean the city or country has a low violent crime rate? Safety can be defined in so many different ways and your own cultural “norms” are going to play a major role in that. When you’re traveling somewhere new, it’s essential to be prepared to get outside of your comfort zone no matter how “safe” you’ve heard it is. The farther you are from home, the more likely you are to run into surprises. Lingering looks or being approached on the street can definitely be unsettling while being talked to in a certain way might make you uncomfortable. One thing to note is that when you’re traveling abroad, oftentimes, there are serious differences in cultural customs—and those have the potential to lead us to feel unsafe.  Identify what makes you feel unsafe so you can properly assess the threat level. Could it be culture shock or are you actually in a bad situation that you want to avoid? One of my main goals with The Blonde Abroad is to give everyone insight and access to my personal travels—helping you plan your trip ahead of time and giving you the tools necessary to aid you in your adventure. Recently, I’ve been noticing some conversations online where individuals felt they got a false impression of a destination being “safe” (through social media) because they experienced catcalling and harassment by local men. Again, this brings to the conversation of “what is safe” and “what is uncomfortable.” The big takeaway is that you are never guaranteed the same experience as someone else. What feels “safe” to me, might feel a bit dodgy to you. We have to take accountability for our own safety and experiences. So, it’s important to seek advice from trusted resources and to also always stay vigilant, regardless of how “safe” you hear a destination is.  I wanted to share a story about how I gained my personal perspective on travel safety. Iceland is ranked as “the safest country in the world” by the Global Peace Index. With political stability and a relatively low crime rate, it’s an ideal solo travel destination for all types of travelers. Because Iceland feels so safe, my mindset was very laid back and I got lazy with taking notice of my surroundings. We were camping and I went in to use the public showers. Believing and feeling how safe it was, I, unfortunately, left my valuables (phone and camera) on top of my towel just outside the shower stall. Guess what? Easy target. It could have been a hardened criminal preying on tourists. Or, it could’ve been a teenager who was taking advantage of an easy situation. While it obviously sucks, I would still consider Iceland an amazing and safe destination to travel to. However, it’s the only time I’ve ever been the “victim” of a crime in all of my travels. The fact is, crime happens everywhere in the world and you become an easier target…if you make it easy. To reverse the example, I’ve been living in South Africa for nearly 3 years. I’ve never had so many people shocked and bothered that I was living in such an “unsafe” destination. And, I get it. To give perspective, Iceland is ranked 1/163 on the GPI while South Africa is ranked 126/163. Almost at the bottom. Pretty much every one of my friends from here has experienced some form of petty crime in their lifetimes. I’ve learned through my travels that where there is desperation, people will do desperate things. And there is a lot of poverty in the country. Knowing that, my body language, my mindset, and my overall vigilance are 110% different to when I travel to places like Iceland. I lock my car doors as soon as I get in. I check my Uber driver’s license plate number before getting in. I don’t walk alone at night. I keep my purse on my lap when I dine out. I read my surroundings and people’s energy and steer clear of anything that seems off. For me, these are not experience-altering measures. Just a normal way of operating here. I still think South Africa is “safe” to explore, you just should stay alert. Check out this article on safety in South Africa from a local’s perspective! Based on my own experiences, I would argue that we should have the same heightened awareness no matter where we are traveling and no matter how palpable the “safety” is—especially when traveling solo.  Dressing in a culturally appropriate way is both respectful and a key element of avoiding unwanted attention. When I traveled to Morocco with a girlfriend, I found the catcalling and unwanted attention quite overwhelming. But, dressing very conservatively and wearing a scarf over my hair helped to divert some of those lingering eyes. While changing the way I dressed didn’t, and won’t, completely negate that attention, it will help you to blend in more. I’ve shared before on what to pack for a trip to a conservative country, but it’s always a good reminder to take a look at!  Dressing to blend in goes a long way. Like it or not, many conservative countries have not-so-great stereotypes about Western women, and showing skin—even when it’s scorching hot—won’t do you any favors. Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on weather and season for when you plan your own trip to a conservative country like Morocco, Jordan, Turkey, UAE, Indonesia, and more!  When someone is making you uncomfortable, it is crucial to keep in mind that it doesn’t always come from a place of malice. During my first trip to China, I traveled to a more remote area of the country and was in total shock at how many people wanted to take my picture. It can make you feel uneasy to be constantly stared at, but some people there had never seen a person who is not of Chinese ancestry, so I might have seemed “unusual and different.”  Similarly, as a solo female in Morocco, I felt like I was constantly being pestered…but at the same time, I never felt physically unsafe. No matter what, I always mentally prepare myself before traveling to Middle Eastern/Islamic countries; I think that Western women might feel a bit intimidated before traveling to these places (based on media and the representation of this part of the world). I personally have had such lovely experiences with locals. But, there are key cultural differences and I know that as a woman in these countries, I might not be treated with the same regard and respect that I would expect back home. Women and men share different roles in different parts of the world—that can be as simple as a man refusing to speak directly to you and have to talk with you through another man, and while that’s a matter of a cultural difference it might feel disrespectful to you. As a Western woman, that is frustrating to me, but I have to realize it’s a cultural difference and not a matter of safety. So while women might not be viewed as second-class citizens, it may feel like that for others that are used to a different culture. It really comes down to men and women play very different roles. If you know what to expect before you go, it’s not so scary and you can better gauge what is alarming versus normal behavior. You can also get destination-specific advice on how to manage and mitigate these situations.  I am a firm believer that solo travel is one of the best experiences anyone can ever have. It does, however, come with extra responsibility. When you travel with a male partner, a girlfriend, or in a group, you have a buffer around you from the outside world. When you are on your own, people are much more likely to approach you and, if you’re not used to this, I can definitely understand how the attention would feel overwhelming. Before you set off on your first solo trip, be sure to read about the ten most common mistakes made by solo female travelers.  No matter where you are, it is crucial to stay alert. This doesn’t mean being scared all the time. It means being smart. Whether you are in England or Bali, there are certain precautions you should always take. First of all, you should let someone know where you are at all times—this can include hotel/hostel staff! When I am solo, I often check-in with them to share my plans. It’s also helpful to talk to locals about different neighborhoods. Familiarize yourself with places to avoid and know your route. Avoid dark alleys and anywhere else that makes you feel uneasy. Before you go, give some thought to what you’re carrying—avoid flashy jewelry and other expensive items. Keep valuables tucked away (as in a camera) in your bag as much as possible. Before you walk out the door, ALWAYS have your phone charged and bring a battery bank. If possible, I’d also advise picking up a local SIM card wherever you are so you don’t always have to find places with WiFi to check-in or get directions. I travel with a mobile WiFi hotspot device for work purposes, but also for safety. If you’re nervous about visiting a destination, the first thing I would suggest is research, research, research! Egypt occupied a top spot on my bucket list for ages; however, I had been hesitant to travel there because of stories I’d heard of women having negative experiences there. While I wholeheartedly believe that other people’s travel experiences don’t predict your own, it did give me an insight into what I might experience. I ended up having a wonderful time exploring Egypt and met so many friendly locals—a total stranger literally handed me her baby! But I do know it can be nerve-wracking when you’re thinking about traveling to a place that doesn’t always get the best reputation for solo travel (like Jordan or Egypt). While I traveled to Egypt solo, I decided to hire a guide for that particular trip, so that I had a local with me during the day and could prevent any unwanted attention. And guess what?! I loved it! I still got to do what I wanted to do, when I wanted to do it. But, I did what I felt would enhance my experience and make me feel comfortable. So, if you want to travel to somewhere but going solo isn’t the route you want to take—no worries! There are tons of options like joining a group tour, you could hire a private tour guide, or you could stay at a high-rated hostel that offers tours and group activities!  If it’s your first time traveling solo—this post is not meant to scare you—but just to make you aware and be a smart traveler! I think being prepared, doing your research, and having realistic expectations are the best things you can do for yourself when heading out on any excursion, whether it’s solo or not. I’d suggest checking out these posts to prepare yourself! 
 While harassment can happen anywhere, no matter what country or culture—and we shouldn’t have to deal with it—the truth of the matter is if we remain quiet or paint picture-perfect images of places or situations, nothing will ever change. That doesn’t mean stop traveling and that doesn’t mean you should live in fear. You will meet good people along the way, you will encounter different things, and you will have experiences that shape you. It’s just better to be prepared and to not gloss over the “not so nice” things that happen. So, ladies, let’s share tips and stories! I am eager to open up the discussion below and hopefully, we can all gain some insight.   Solo travel for women can be challenging — I’ve learned so much over the years (and I’m continually learning!). I put together this comprehensive guide to solo travel destinations and taking solo trips so you can better prepare for your next trip!

 Hi Kiki! As a solo female traveler (but mostly around Southeast Asia so far), I could totally relate to most of your anecdotes. I’ve been dreaming of making it solo in Europe next time, but I think I need to exercise more precaution in the future. This pandemic has got me researching more and preparing, hence I stumbled upon your post. Thanks for sharing your thoughts! Safe travels! 🙂 Hi Sherr! Thank you for the kind words. And as much as I love being spontaneous, doing your research and figuring out plans ahead of time is SUPER helpful! 🙂 Hi Kiki,
I’ve been reading your blog for a few years now!
I’m super tempted to travel to Asia on my own, but I’m 34 and do NOT like the idea of being woken up at all hours in a dorm in a hostel… and i’m worried that a hotel would be out of my price-range? do you have any suggestions, please? thank you! Many hostels offer private rooms! That’s one option. And depending on where you’re traveling, you might be surprised how cheap some accommodation can be. I still always check hotels too!

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/six-travel-budget-busters-to-avoid/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  Whether you are sticking to a tight budget while traveling or not, no one likes to waste their hard-earned money on travel budget busters that can be avoided. After visiting 70+ countries, I’ve learned a thing or two—mostly from trial and error—that I’d love to share with you. The actual destination of your trip can play a big factor in cost, so I've compiled a list of 10 budget-friendly travel destinations around the world! Travel can make you thirsty—whether you’re hopping on a redeye or wandering around a new city. You’ll probably find yourself spending too much on beverages—a glass of wine here, an overpriced latte there, and two more water bottles than you actually need. Is it a party night? Enjoy a beer with friends in your room or the hostel lounge before you head out for a night of drinking or dancing. While you’re out, try some local beer or liquor—these are usually cheaper than imports like Heineken or Budweiser. In many countries, coffee is an overpriced luxury. Avoid chains like Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts and try a local barista. Sometimes they’ll even have a local flavor… oat milk in Iceland, anyone?.  Order a regular coffee, and you’ll often get a refill, unlike with those expensive cappuccinos and lattes you have to order one by one. Money is no excuse not to travel. Through my adventures I have gathered some budget-busters. Here are six ways to spend less on travel! Europe is a great region to explore on a budget. Here is a breakdown of typical expenses so you know how much to budget for backpacking Europe! A one-of-a-kind souvenir is like a memory you can hold and take back home with you. Checking out the markets for something fun and memorable is a great way to interact with locals, practice your threadbare language skills, and do some shopping. You can often end up with much more than you bargained for (and more than can fit in your suitcase). When out shopping, have a loose idea of what you’re looking for: a boomerang from Australia, an ostrich egg from South Africa, a straw doll from Belarus. This will help you focus. Keep your eyes open throughout the day—even when not actively shopping—just in case you stumble on something truly unique. If you are thinking of taking your first trip to the region, here are travel tips for first-timers interested in backpacking Southeast Asia! As a large and diverse continent, you will have different experiences wherever you explore. Here is my beginner's guide to backpacking South America! Using your phone abroad, if not properly set up, can cost you a pretty penny. As long as you have wireless connection, you can use anyone’s WiFi abroad—mobile data is another story. Make sure you speak with your service provider about international options. It can sometimes switch on international data at a low cost for a limited time. I’ve been traveling with a Solis WiFi hotspot, and I couldn’t go back. You literally just turn on your hotspot and it’ll automatically connect to the local network. Just check the coverage map before you go to make sure you will be covered, and you’re set. You don’t need to register or even know which local networks you are using. From figuring out what kind of trip you're after to who pays for what to ways to stretch your dollars—here's how to budget for a trip when traveling as a couple! You’ll want to check with your bank for any potential international ATM fees or direct card charges that may apply during travel, before you embark. Many banks charge a percentage for each transaction and often more for ATM withdrawals. While you’re logged in to your bank’s portal, provide the names of the countries on your itinerary—failing to alert your bank of travel may cause your cards to be blocked. And that would be a BAD start to a vacation! So you’ve got your flight booked...now what? There are lots of planning steps to take before your next trip to make it a breeze. Here are 10 things you should never forget before a trip! More and more airlines are charging by the item—for the seat, for food, for extra bags. Save yourself stress and hassle by arranging all of it online prior to your trip. Before your flight, log in to your itinerary on the airline’s website with your confirmation code and pre purchase any extra items or services. Need an aisle seat in economy plus seating? Buy it online. Carrying more bags than the allotted one or two? Buy it online. Airlines will often charge you extra if you make any of these arrangements at the airport on your day of departure. If you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card, I recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase. Some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels. Plus, many cards offer additional points when making travel-related purchases. Some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card. My personal favorite is the Chase Sapphire Reserve (for frequent travelers) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred (if you’re just starting out)! Check out my favorite travel reward credit cards!  Want to fly around the world for free? Here's my guide on how to choose a travel credit card, start earning miles and redeem your points for airline miles! Let me tell you this: travel reward credit card points are a GAME CHANGER. Here’s how I travel the world for free (using credit card points!)  Accidents do happen and often when you least expect them. You may fall ill with the stomach flu or sprain your ankle walking the Spanish Steps. In these instances, you’ll be thankful for travel insurance. Buy insurance to cover your nonrefundable costs and any emergency medical expenses. Look for a plan that will cover you before you go as well as while you’re on the road. I have an annual plan with World Nomads, so if I’m ever delayed, miss a flight, or catch a bad cold while traveling, I’m covered! There’s even travel insurance to cover specific types of travel—are you a photographer? Make sure the plan includes electronic theft or loss. Are you an adventure sports enthusiast? There are plans for you too. I have always been the type of person that looked at travel insurance as an unnecessary expense that would only help me in the unlikely case that something really bad happened. But, things have changed. I'm getting travel insurance. Travel insurance is one of the most important things that you can purchase for any trip. Here are ten reasons to get travel insurance for your next trip.

 These are great tips! I hadn’t really thought about planning out souvenir purchases before, but you are absolutely right–if you don’t, especially when flying to a destination, you end up spending more than planned, and then it’s a challenge getting those extra items home. Absolutely! It can be a challenge, and who wants to give up souvenirs?

BlondeAbroad,https://theblondeabroad.com/7-budget-travel-tips-for-student-travelers/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  Think you can’t afford to travel? Think again! Traveling doesn’t have to be expensive. While trying to see as much of the world as I possibly can, I have learned a few ways to stretch a dollar. With a few budgeting tricks, you can see the world for next to nothing. Here are my top seven budget travel tips!   Location is everything! While $100 might not get you through the day in France, it could last you for more than a week in Southeast Asia. A lot of travel newbies let airfare prices make the decision for them but that can be a mistake. For a more realistic view of travel costs, you’ll want to consider the cost of transportation, accommodation, and activities. While flights to Europe and North America might be cheaper, hotel rooms, food, and excursions will be infinitely more expensive than in South America or Asia. Consider all costs before you decide what’s the most affordable option. Check out my beginners’ guides to backpacking in South America, Southeast Asia, Central America and Europe.   Accommodation is a major cost. Why not get it for free? I absolutely love volunteering abroad. Not only will it save you cash, it’s an all-around amazing experience. Stay with a local for free, get insider tips, and give back to the community. It’ll totally transform your experience.   Flight prices can vary an unbelievable amount. While booking early might not always get you the best price, you don’t want to wait until the last minute either. One tool I love is the Skyscanner Price Alert. Enter the flight info you are looking for and then get alerts when the price changes. Just glancing at your alerts over a few weeks can save you hundreds. Know what’s a good price, and commit to grabbing your tickets when you get a low price alert.   Before you go, figure out your transportation options. Taking taxis and planes everywhere can add up quickly and take up a large portion of your travel budget. Look into public transportation options to get from the airport and around the city! For short journeys, citywide bike sharing programs can be a fun and cheap way to get around. If you are visiting multiple destinations, look into trains, buses, and ride sharing options. Not sure what the best pick is? Don’t be shy about using forums. Locals and fellow traveler will be happy to help you out.   Think outside of the hotel room! Grab a free couch, rent an apartment or room on Airbnb, check out a local hostel, or do a homestay. There are so many different options that will save you money and give you a priceless look into how locals live. Search with an open mind and decide what’s best for you and your budget.     Student cards are awesome. Did you know that you can get discounts at more than 125,000 places in 133 countries around the world? With flash sales on transatlantic flights for $99, a whopping 35 percent discount on Eurail, and so much more, your student card is your BFF. Sometimes you can travel with the university card issued by your school but it’s not a guarantee. The gold standard is the International Student Identity Card (a.k.a. the ISIC).   Upgrade your layover and cross another destination off your bucket list for free! Rather than rushing through the airport to catch your next flight, get outside and see the city–there are many airlines that will get you a free stopover in their hub city. See Reykjavik with Icelandair, Dubai with Emirates, Tokyo with Japan Airlines, Singapore with Singapore Air, Bangkok with Thai Airways, or countless other options!

I love these refillable travel jars from Kitsch for traveling with my serums, moisturizers, and masks! I opt for their larger travel bottles for my shampoo, conditioner, and lotions (and they’re BPA-free!). Shampoo bars are SO great for travel — not only do you not have to lug around more “liquids” it also reduces plastic-consumption and can double as body/hand soap if you want to travel light. The Acure Coconut & Argan Shampoo Bar has a coconut oil soap base and is palm oil-free. It’s gentle on all hair types and free of all those “nasties.” I typically use a high-quality face wash but when I’m traveling or even hitting a workout class, I love to have some hydrating wipes to remove makeup or just to freshen up. I love these facial wipes from RAWGANIC because they’re made with natural, clean ingredients and are 100% Organic Cotton so they are biodegradable and plastic-free. I wear sunscreen on my face daily! It’s the best way to prevent sun damage which leads to wrinkles, hyperpigmentation and more. I love PCA SKIN Sheer Tint SPF 45 — it’s creamy and feels AMAZING on my face. It’s not greasy and you can layer makeup on top of it nicely. It’s worth the investment for your skin! These natural eye gels are so travel-friendly. They have soothing Vitamins C + E to repair skin and reduce wrinkles, plus they have a unique blend of elasticity-boosting collagen sourced from cacti! Plus, one of the key ingredients is aloe vera which is so hydrating for your skin. Goodbye puffy eyes after a long haul flight! Helpful Trick: Put these on about an hour before landing on a long flight so I land feeling refreshed and ready to go! As someone who has struggled with acne my whole life, I couldn’t be happier about this product. It’s hard to keep up with a skin regimen constantly on the road, so these No B.S. Acne Patches minimize scarring while promotes rapid healing — and they’re pretty discreet. Vitamin C is so good for brightening your skin and evening out skin tone! The Ursa Major Brighten Up Vitamin C Serum is super lightweight and infused with aloe to hydrate without weighing skin down. The stable Vitamin C brightens and firms skin as powerhouse rose hip lightens dark spots and softens the look of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s some serious “clean” beauty! I’ve been using a crystal nail file for years on the road — the double-sided filing surface allows you to file your nails with a lighter touch, and in any direction, without damaging the nail. Not only is it a handy space saver, but also it lasts for ages! This lightweight, fast-absorbing lotion is full of natural actives to calm, hydrate and nourish skin without clogging pores or creating shine. It’s perfect for a daily moisturizer that you can reapply anytime! Refillable Perfume Bottle
If you’re like me, you LOVE fragrances but not lugging around the whole, precious bottle. This refillable perfume bottle is perfect for taking your favorite scent on-the-go!

BlondeAbroad,https://www.theblondeabroad.com/solo-female-travelers-guide-to-madrid/,"The Blonde Abroad Popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips, fashion, food and photography from around the world. Follow Kiersten on her adventures!  Ever thought about taking a little adventure just for you? The kind where you wander a new city at your own pace, meet amazing locals, and soak up a culture that’s completely different from home? If you’re craving a destination with history, AMAZING food, gorgeous architecture — and one that feels super safe for solo travelers — then it’s time to put Madrid on your radar. With delicious food, affordable living, and deluxe shopping, the capital of Spain deserves its own spotlight of fame. Check out all of my tips in the ultimate Madrid travel guide! After studying abroad in Spain, I could still spend years exploring. From Madrid to Barcelona to Girona to Bilbao, it’s such a vibrant country. Madrid makes it almost impossible to choose where to stay…in the best way. You’ve got everything from luxe five-star hideaways to boutique gems and hotels with rooftop pools. Wherever you check in, you’ll feel right at home and instantly welcomed. Many hotels also offer those extra touches that make a trip feel special: think beautiful spas, great restaurants, and super unique interiors. If you’re looking for places to stay, here are my top recommendations. New openings worth checking out: Iconic Madrid favorites: Madrid is one of the most sociable cities you’ll ever visit, and you feel it instantly. The vibe is warm, lively, and so easy to slip into. Make sure to add these local experiences to your itinerary to really make the most of it. Do what the locals do: grab a seat at a terraza (aka a restaurant in the open air), order some tapas or a glass of wine, and just enjoy the moment. “Terraceo”, or moving from terraza to terraza, is all about hopping between outdoor tables, sharing plates, and people-watching. “Tardeo” is its early-evening cousin, relaxed, fun, and perfect if you don’t want a late night. For a classic Madrid moment, wander through the huge El Retiro Park (it’s 125 hectares!). For a bit of fun, jump in one of the multicolored boats to row around the lake. If you’re in town on a Sunday, head to Plaza de Cascorro in the central neighborhood of La Latina to explore El Rastro. It’s full of stalls selling vintage finds, clothing, accessories, and handmade goods for all ages. End your visit with a customary aperitivo in the area’s bars and tabernas, pairing a glass of wine, beer, or vermouth on tap with tapas like some paella or cod fritters. And yep, this tradition goes all the way back to the 18th century, so it’s hard to say no to! Need a little extra guidance while you’re in Madrid? Stop by one of the city’s tourist information centers — the Plaza Mayor Information Centre is open year-round. You can also use the virtual tourist video assistance service if you prefer quick, on-the-go answers. Madrid is a dream for foodies, especially if you enjoy wandering around, sharing plates, and discovering places locals actually love. I highly recommend taking a tapas tour to find the best authentic spots and to learn more about the food, culture, and history. Start in neighborhoods like Madrid de los Austrias (Habsburg Madrid), La Latina, and Barrio de las Letras (Literary Quarter). These central pockets are full of traditional tapas bars and give you that classic Madrid food experience without having to go too far. If you want to step off the tourist path, try Chueca, Malasaña, Conde Duque, or Lavapiés. Each neighborhood has its own vibe, from trendy and creative to international and eclectic, and they’re all packed with great, casual spots full of Madrileños. Near El Retiro, Boulevard de Ibiza is lined with bars and terrazas that locals adore. And Calle de Ponzano in Chamberí is one of the city’s trendiest foodie streets, perfect for hopping between bars all afternoon or evening. I went to Madrid for the third time recently, and was really excited to do so. Here are my top picks of places for the best food in Madrid! Did you know that the third Thursday of June is World Tapas Day? I'm all for getting festive, so naturally, the only way to celebrate is by tasting all the tapas! Traveling solo in Madrid is a dream if you love culture, as there’s always something to see, explore, or stumble upon. The city is packed with museums, galleries, historic landmarks, and creative spaces that make simply wandering feel like an adventure in itself. Begin at Paseo del Prado and El Retiro Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This area is home to Madrid’s “big three” museums: You’ll also find beautiful spots like the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Royal Spanish Language Academy, the National Museum of Decorative Arts, and even the Royal Astronomical Observatory. Madrid is full of charming, lesser-known museums that are perfect for a quieter morning or afternoon. Don’t miss the Sorolla Museum, the Lázaro Galdiano Museum, the Lope de Vega house-museum, or the Museum of Romanticism. If you’re into contemporary art and design, places like Matadero Madrid, Casa Encendida, and Conde Duque offer exhibitions, performances, and installations. You’ll also find plenty of independent galleries, especially around the Reina Sofía museum. For something fun in the evening, see a musical along the Gran Vía — Madrid’s version of Broadway. If opera is more your style, Teatro Real is one of the world’s top opera houses and absolutely worth experiencing. Whether you are staying in the city for a short weekend or a couple of weeks, here are the top seven things to see and do in Madrid! Renting a bike is such a fun way to see a different side of Madrid.  Start with Madrid Río Park, a long stretch of riverside paths and gardens that used to have a city motorway running through it, but is now a calm, green space perfect for cycling. It’s an easy, scenic ride and feels worlds away from the busy streets. If you want even more nature, head to Casa de Campo, the city’s largest public park. You can ride for miles here, stop at a terraza by the amazing artificial lake (that dates back to the 16th century!), or even take out one of the rowboats for a moment on the water. Spain is made up of multiple regions, and they all offer female travelers something different. Food, culture and beaches are all available in Spain! Madrid is firmly on the list of Spain’s best travel destinations, especially if you love shopping! And don’t just stick to the name brands, Madrid has plenty of independent shops where you can find truly unique pieces. If you love bringing home souvenirs that feel personal and tied to the place, you’ll have plenty to choose from — capes, handcrafted fans, ceramics, jewelry, handbags, tapestries, violet sweets, even traditional Spanish guitars. For the best mix of old and new, explore neighborhoods like: As you wander, you’ll come across century-old institutions like Capas Seseña, Sombrerería Medrano, and Guitarras Ramírez, as well as contemporary studios such as Andrés Gallardo with his distinctive jewelry pieces, and Javier Medina, known for his “ecological trophies” crafted from bamboo. Make the most of your Madrid layover with my shopping guide. Discover luxe boutiques and local gems to refresh your wardrobe for Europe. Madrid has a way of slowing you down in all the right ways, especially at sunset. It’s the perfect time to take a breath, soak in the moment, and enjoy some of the city’s most magical viewpoints. For dreamy golden-hour views, head to spots like Las Vistillas Gardens or the Mirador de la Cornisa by the Royal Palace. Another favorite is the area around Oeste Park, home to the Temple of Debod, an ancient Egyptian monument that gives sunset a little extra mystery. As you guys might have noticed, I absolutely adore Spain. Here are my tips for the best time to go to Spain and experience the beautiful country! If you want a fun night out in Madrid, book a spot somewhere that mixes great food with great music. There are plenty of places that pair set menus with live performances, like Aurora, Bule Bule, and Fanático, all known for their lively atmosphere and creative dining rooms. If flamenco is on your list (and it absolutely should be!), check out the program at Corral de la Morería. It’s one of the most iconic flamenco venues in the world and even offers Michelin-star dining. Tablao de la Villa and Las Carboneras are also fantastic options, combining incredible flamenco shows with classic Spanish dishes. Ready to say hola to one of Europe’s greatest destinations? Here are my favorite ten places to visit in Spain (that aren’t Barcelona). To end your day on a high note, head up to one of Madrid’s many rooftop bars or restaurants. The city does rooftop culture incredibly well, with skyline views that feel even prettier after sunset. Some favorites to bookmark include: So, have I sold you on Madrid yet?! With more direct flights to Madrid from U.S. hubs than ever before, the city is fast becoming one of the best cities in Europe to visit. Madrid weather is pleasantly mild in spring and fall — perfect for sightseeing without blistering heat — allowing you to wander its grand boulevards and sunny plazas in total comfort. And whether you’re strolling through the Royal Palace or catching a live flamenco show, all the best things to do in Madrid deliver on both culture and fun. I think you will fall in love with the heart of Spain as much as I did! Ready to see the world? Do it on your own time line! For the ultimate solo trip, travel alone in one of these amazing cities!

The @staywandery concierge service. They helped us coordinate an in-home hibachi dinner night (yes, comedic chef + fire + kids losing their minds). They can arrange everything for your visit from private chefs to photographers to yoga instructors — making group travel easier and more memorable. ✨It’s the kind of place where you don’t need a packed itinerary — the experience is the house.Tag your group — this is the trip you’ll be talking about for years!••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••#palmsprings #familytravel
