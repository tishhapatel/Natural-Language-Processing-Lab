i m a sucker for a good travel rewards card over the years i ve collected a small handful of them not because i love juggling annual fees but because the right cards can save you a lot of money on flights hotels and travel perks you d otherwise pay out of pocket for not only do i have a bunch for my personal expenses but i have a couple for this business too one of my favorite business credit cards is the capital one venture x business credit card it s capital one s top tier business product i love it because there s a big welcome offer lounge access to over airport lounges annual travel credits and a simple x reward on all spending which ensures you are always earning multiples miles per dollar spent to help you decide if this card is for you here s my full review of the card and why i love it so much table of contentswhat is the capital one venture x business card using your capital one milespros of the venture x business cardshould you get this card table of contents the capital one venture x business credit card is a travel rewards card issued by capital one it comes with a annual fee that is way lower than the other premium business cards out there and i think you can easily get way more value than the annual fee costs here s a quick look at the main perks capital one miles can be redeemed in a few ways one is by booking travel directly through capital one s portal while i usually don t recommend booking through credit card portals to fully benefit from the venture x s travel credit and to get the x and x miles offers you ll need to use their portal another option is to use your miles to get reimbursed for any travel purchase for days after making such a purchase you can reimburse yourself at a redemption rate of one cent per mile after days and for all other purchases you can use miles as cash back at a redemption rate of cents per mile but avoid doing this as it s not a good value you can also use your capital one miles in the capital one entertainment portal to book tickets for concerts sports events and more occasionally capital one offers cardholder only events and presale opportunities too while you ll get just cents per mile for tickets not the best value it s still a fun and unique way to redeem miles however you ll get the most out of your miles by transferring them to capital one s airline and hotel partners while the actual value varies based on what you book you can usually find airline and hotel redemptions worth much more than the aforementioned one cent per mile the process is pretty straightforward and can be done through your capital one account here are capital one s current travel partners as someone who travels constantly for work i m always looking for ways to earn miles faster and make airport life a little less painful i like this card for the simple x miles on everything i use a lot of other cards that can get you or x on certain categories like advertising or non portal travel spend like flights and hotels but when it comes to dining museums transportation etc there s not a lot of ways to get more than x per dollar spent on a business card so i use this venture x for anything i can t get more than x per dollar here s a deep dive into some of the main perks travel credit each year you get a credit toward bookings made through capital one business travel flights hotels or car rentals if you re already booking travel regularly this credit is basically free money and it immediately drops your effective annual fee from to the catch you do have to book through capital one s travel portal it s powered by hopper so the interface is clean and prices are usually competitive i ve found some good deals there lounge access you get access to capital one lounges and priority pass lounges capital one s own lounges are actually great spacious modern good food though they re still limited location but they are expanding how many they have and i personally think they are way better than the other lounges competitor banks have you also get priority pass access t o over lounges globally which is a common but really nice perk anniversary bonus every year on your account anniversary you ll get bonus miles worth about toward travel it s a nice thank you that helps offset the annual fee even further the capital one venture x business credit card is best for small to medium sized business owners who travel regularly and can put at least to ensure they meet the welcome offer requirements overall i think the capital one venture x business is one of the best value premium business cards out there right now it s not as benefit packed or as flashy as the the business platinum card from american express or the chase sapphire reserve for business but it s easier to use has a less expensive annual fee gets you lounge access and an easy to understand earning structure it s one of the cards i use the most often for my business i highly recommend getting it download

matt s travel site let s face it not everyone is going to be able to travel whether it s money family obligations or circumstance travel is out of reach for a large percentage of the world s population in the quit your job to travel the world cheerleading that happens so often on travel websites including this one we often forget that it s not so easy for everyone yes years on the road have shown me that for many of us our inability to travel is partly a mindset issue since we believe travel is expensive we don t look for ways to make it cheaper and partly a spending issue we spend money on things we don t need our culture says travel is expensive and without a frame of reference to know that that is wrong people just assume it s right and yes people who have decent paying jobs but go shopping often or spend a lot on avocado toast or whatever it is they spend money on are more often than not prioritizing travel but there are those for whom no mindset change spending cuts or budget tips will help them travel those who are too sick have parents or children to care for face great debt or work three jobs just to pay their rent after all billion people nearly of the world s population survive on less than usd a day in my home country of the united states of the population is below the poverty line million people are on food stamps many have to work two jobs to get by and we have a trillion dollars in student debt dragging people down no tips on any website will magically make travel a reality for those people those of us who do travel are a privileged few whether we quit our jobs to travel the world spend two months in europe or take our kids on a short vacation to disney world we get to experience something most people in the world will never get a chance to do we overlook that fact too often we overlook how lucky we are i grew up in a predominately white middle class town with parents who paid my college tuition i had a job after college that allowed me to live on my own take vacations and still save for my first trip around the world and because i speak english i easily found work teaching english in thailand where i could save to extend my travels that s not to say that hard work doesn t count but hard work doesn t exist in a bubble and the circumstances that create the opportunities for hard work to bear fruit are often more important i ve met people of all ages incomes abilities and nationalities on the road folks like don and alison who are backpacking the world at michael who worked hour weeks at a minimum wage job cory who travels the world in a wheelchair ishwinder who didn t let visa restrictions stop him and countless others but even they had circumstances that allowed them to travel support from family and friends jobs that allowed for overtime or other skills they weren t barely getting by or on social assistance they didn t wonder if they could afford their next meal i worked hard to get where i am i m sure you ve worked hard too one s work isn t less because of opportunity but i think it s important to remember that the circumstances around you make it easier for your work to bear fruit than for others it s easier to succeed when you don t have to worry about housing or your next meal it s easier to succeed if you re educated or can get a full night s sleep in a safe community we are some of the lucky ones we get to do something that others will never be able to do we are privileged even if you ve hitchhiked around the world with no money worked overseas cut costs to travel around the world on usd a day or used points and miles to get a first class ticket you have the opportunity to do something most people go to sleep only dreaming about you have the freedom and choice to move about the world in a way most people don t that s a form of privilege as we go into this new year i think it s important that we never forget or be ungrateful for the opportunity we have let s not take it for granted let s be humble let s be more respectful let s give back and let s not squander the opportunity how to travel the world on a daymy new york times best selling book to travel will teach you how to

nomadic matt s travel site tokyo is one of those cities that feels endlessly deep you can visit a dozen times and still discover new food stalls hidden shrines late night bars quirky subcultures and neighborhoods that feel like completely different worlds i know because i ve visited about times already one of my favorite ways to explore tokyo is by taking an airbnb experience led by locals and long term residents these tours give you a front row seat to tokyo s food culture nightlife history and crafts in a way you rarely get when wandering on your own i ve done a lot of airbnb experiences in tokyo over the years and think they are often even better than traditional tours you find on get your guide though arigato travel is next level and the best traditional tour company in the city so don t miss out on them to help you pick from the endless experiences you can find below are my favorite in tokyo that combine cultural immersion hands on learning and just the right amount of fun sushi making classes are common in tokyo but this airbnb experience stands out because it s done in an omakase restaurant this class is given by a sushi master or his apprentice you don t just learn how to shape rice or slice fish you learn why certain cuts matter how chefs season rice differently depending on style and how to pair ingredients to highlight texture and flavor the class is hands on and surprisingly approachable it s a small group experience done in the morning so you can have a filling and fun breakfast experience before going out to explore tokyo i absolutely loved it book here this is my favorite nightlife tour in tokyo the host suemi and her friends provide the absolute best time this shibuya nightlife tour one takes you to izakaya spots that are very untouristy and filled without locals you get unlimited food and drinks and it s a really great experience my guide shugo was outgoing spoke conversational english handled large group dynamics well was entertaining explained the culture of izakaya restaurants in detail and stayed past when the experienced ended he was great additionally suemi and her friends also run an unlimited sake tasting class which is the best sake class i ve done in tokyo they go into incredible detail about how sake is made and use a lot of visuals so it s really easy to understand it s a small group of six which made the experience really personable if you take a sake experience take this one they also un a whiskey tasting experience that i haven t done this one yet but i bet it s just as good book here this experience is similar in spirit to the shibuya nightlife tour but set in one of tokyo s other major nightlife hubs shinjuku is packed with tiny izakaya spots many of them hidden in narrow alleyways or upstairs spaces you d never think to enter on your own on this tour yuma a knowledgeable sake sommelier takes you to several of these small local spots and walks you through how izakaya culture really works you ll try different styles of sake along the way and learn how to read menus what to order and how locals typically drink and eat in these settings yuma is outgoing fun and very good at explaining things clearly without overwhelming you it s social relaxed and a great way to experience shinjuku nightlife without feeling lost or intimidated book here this is one of the most educational experiences i ve done in tokyo instead of focusing on the usual tourist areas this tour explores quieter neighborhoods that retain a strong connection to the city s past the host is a lecturer specializing in japanese history and traditional culture and it really shows in the depth of information shared throughout the walk you ll visit places like nezu shrine walk through its tunnel of red torii gates explore the old streets of yanaka and learn about the edo period the meiji restoration and how the role of the samurai changed as japan modernized it s a hour walk that never feels rushed and gives you a much clearer understanding of how tokyo became the city it is today i learned a lot from this tour book here tokyo has an burgeoning coffee scene and this tour does a great job of showing it to you you explore jimbocho and kanda two very under visited neighborhoods to learn about both old school kissaten and modern specialty caf s you ll learn about brewing techniques flavor profiles and how japan developed such a meticulous approach to coffee the tour includes visits to historic caf s specialty shops leading tokyo s third wave movement and even wagashi shops where you ll learn how traditional japanese sweets pair with coffee it s a really thoughtful and unique afternoon experience book here this one hour experience is a great introduction to matcha and japanese tea culture you ll learn about the history of matcha its role in japanese society and how to tell high quality matcha from lower grade varieties the host walks you through the traditional preparation process step by step you ll whisk and taste authentic matcha in a calm traditional setting that feels worlds away from tokyo s busy streets it s short but memorable and it gives you a much deeper appreciation for something you ll see everywhere while traveling in japan book here ramen is synonymous with japanese food and this tour helps you understand why it inspires such devotion over the course of about three hours you ll visit multiple ramen shops each highlighting a different style or approach you ll learn about ramen s origins modern trends and regional variations while tasting everything from classic bowls to more experimental or fusion styles the guide explains broth types noodle textures and toppings in a way that s easy to follow come hungry as this tour will absolutely fill you up book here this tour takes you through shibuya and harajuku to see murals and installations hidden in alleyways and less obvious spaces street art is a much quieter more underground scene in tokyo they japanese aren t so keen on murals on their buildings so learning about where it is allowed and how the culture thrives in such a restrictive environment is really interesting he tour also includes visual examples of murals before and after they were created which adds helpful context i think it is one of the most interesting and unique airbnb experiences and gives you a really good look at a side of japan most people don t see book here there s a lot of airbnb experiences in tokyo and i know i m probably i m missing some really great ones after all i m only one person but these eight will give you a good start try to do at least one when you re in tokyo because most conventional organized tours are all cookie cutter experiences these airbnb tours are way more fun book your flight use skyscanner to find a cheap flight they are my favorite search engine because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is left unturned book your accommodation you can book your hostel with hostelworld as they have the biggest inventory and best deals if you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel use booking com as they consistently return

whether you re figuring out the best route to your hostel finding a place to eat or translating a train schedule or menu having reliable data makes life on the road infinitely easier i still remember my early days of travel carrying a physical guidebook around as i wandered the streets looking for my accommodation or when smartphones became widespread searching for a sim card kiosk to buy a physical sim trying to poorly communicate with staff in a language i didn t know and spending minutes swapping out tiny plastic chips luckily things have changed and life is incredibly easier thanks to esims rather than needing a physical sim card you can download an app that gives you tons of high speed data in a world where we need to be connected for so many reasons for example everything in china is paid through an app so you need data esims are great one company that s become a major player in this space is holafly use the code mattk to get a discount they offer unlimited data quick setup and global coverage without the hassle of finding a physical sim card in a world of seemingly never ending esim companies they are one of the best in this blog post i will tell you why holafly is a spanish founded company that started back in and is now based in dublin they offer esims that you can install on your phone via qr code once activated they let you connect to the internet abroad using local carrier networks what sets holafly apart from a lot of other providers is that over of their options come with unlimited data and are priced by days rather than gigabytes you can personalize the days from up to days in over destinations holafly s coverage is also pretty extensive they offer service in over destinations which includes most of europe asia north america and latin america the process of setting up holafly is incredibly straightforward here is how to do it check your phone first make sure your device is unlocked and supports esim most recent iphones and many newer androids do have a wi fi connection handy for setup save the email qr keep the qr code and order info somewhere safe install the esim while on wi fi open the confirmation email and scan the qr code from your phone camera or tap the activation link there are three options on iphone settings cellular or mobile data add cellular plan scan the qr on android settings network internet or connections sims or mobile network add esim add mobile plan scan the qr exact labels vary by phone on arrival enable data roaming for the esim go to cellular mobile data settings select the holafly line and turn on data roaming and mobile data for that line turn off mobile data for your home sim to avoid accidental roaming charges holafly partners with local carriers so your connection depends on whichever network is strongest in that region note that holafly s esims are data only you can keep your home sim card in your phone for texts or calls while holafly handles all your data apps like whatsapp imessage and telegram will still work with your regular number so you can message friends and family just like you would at home the unlimited data promise is what draws most people in and for good reason most esim companies sell data in small bundles which adds up quickly especially if you re using maps social media or video calls with holafly you just pay for the number of days you need and get unlimited data during that time plans start at around usd per day though they are cheaper if you get more days or choose their new subscription options holafly plans plus holafly offers customer support multilingual hotspot capabilities regional esims a global esim no hidden costs and an incredible month flexible refund policy i think it s one of the best esim options for travelers who want reliability and ease of use it s especially great for people visiting multiple countries or anyone who relies heavily on mobile data bloggers remote workers or digital nomads the connection has been consistent speeds are good and the ability to set everything up before i even leave home is a huge time saver at the end of the day that s really what makes holafly appealing simplicity you don t have to think about data sim cards or network compatibility you just scan activate and go for travelers like me that convenience is priceless use the code mattk to get a discount on any esim for

pro copyright nomadic matt s travel site as the sun rises on a new year we look out on the horizon and commit to being a better version of ourselves and often one of those commitments is travel this year we will travel more we say we ponder the exotic locations we hope to find ourselves in we think of the adventures we ll go on and the people we ll meet we begin to formulate plans research trips and save money but as the year progresses most will abandon those dreams forever pushing them off as life throws them curveballs that derail their aspirations chances are you ll find a reason why today just isn t the right day tomorrow you ll say today isn t perfect and i just have too many things to do now is not the right time the right time is usually when you have more money or more time off or when things aren t so crazy then you ll be able to travel the stars need to align a little more and things need to be a little less busy but here s a secret it s never going to be the right time to travel the idea that the stars will align and you ll find the perfect day to step out of your door and into the world is fantasy today might not be the perfect day but neither is tomorrow tomorrow you ll find another excuse why you can t go tomorrow there will still be more bills to pay tomorrow there still won t be enough money tomorrow there will still be someone s wedding or birthday party to attend tomorrow there will still be more planning to do tomorrow people you know will still sow the seeds of doubt in your head tomorrow you ll still worry about all the bad stuff that might happen to you tomorrow you still won t know if you re making the right decision tomorrow you will still second guess yourself tomorrow something else will come up and you ll say to yourself today isn t the right day let s try again tomorrow tomorrow will never be perfect because there is no such thing as perfection i mean doesn t it feel like so much of adult life is saying next week will just be a little better knowing full that next week is not going to be any less crazy than this week the hardest part of any journey is stepping out the door and one of the key components to making that first step easier is to understand that the stars will never align and there will never be the right moment to travel you just have to go you have to leap you have to trust yourself that it will all work out because it will if i had waited for the perfect day when my friend said he would join he never did or when i had just a bit more money i d still be home in my cubicle job back then i was constantly worried i hadn t saved enough money i was constantly worried i didn t have the skills to survive on the road there was always a reason to put off my trip but sometimes you just have to take the leap and go for it ships aren t meant to stay in a harbor you weren t meant to stay at home and wonder what if because one day you ll run out of tomorrows and you ll be filled with nothing but sadness and regret so stop waiting stop making excuses this is your year it doesn t matter if you can only save a dollar per day just start action begets action don t worry too much about tomorrow everything will work out your bills will disappear when you cancel the services that generate them you ll make more friends on the road than you could ever imagine you can work overseas and if it doesn t work out you can always come home the world is full of possibilities and you re capable of doing great things but only if you start today how to travel the world on a daymy new york

so you can plan your trip like a pro copyright nomadic matt s travel site when i first started traveling my dad used to ask what i m running away from with my travels another time a commenter told me to stop running away from my problems and to start living life grow up he said and years ago there was even a blog called mom says i m running away i m not sure why but there is this perception out there that anyone who travels long term and isn t interested in settling down or getting a conventional job must be running away from something we travelers are running away from responsibility being a grown up heartache problems etc etc we are all just peter pans refusing to be adults while american society thinks traveling is something everyone should do at one point it s only gap years after college or short vacations that seem to be acceptable get it out of your system and come back into the matrix those of us who lead nomadic lifestyles or who linger just a bit too long somewhere before reaching that final homestretch are all too often accused of running away yes go travel but not for too long the world says responsible people don t just travel forever we nomads must have awful miserable lives or are weird or have had something traumatic happen to us that we are trying to escape people assume that we are simply running away from our problems running away from the real world and to all those people who think i am running away i say you are right i am running away i m running away from your idea of the real world i m avoiding your life i m running towards everything towards the world exotic places new people different cultures and my own idea of freedom i m building a life that makes me happy while there may be exceptions as there are with everything most people who become nomads do so because they want to experience the world not escape their problems they are running away from office life commutes and weekend errands and the corporate to they are running away from the strict path society has laid out as normal the one that makes us mindless ants marching to and fro we i want to experience every culture see every mountain eat different food attend crazy festivals meet new people and enjoy different holidays around the world we want to construct a life that makes us happy on our own terms life is short and we only get to live it once i want to look back and say i did exciting things and lived life on my own terms not say i spent my life reading blogs like this during my lunch break while wishing i was doing the same thing no one dies saying if only i had spent more time in the office as an american my perspective might be different in my country the accepted path is long and narrow you go to college get a job get married buy a house have children raise them and then retire only then after you ve put in your time can you enjoy the fruits of your labor society boxes you in and restricts your movements to their expectations and any deviation is considered abnormal and weird people may want to travel tell you they envy what you do and say they wish they could do the same thing but they never do few people muster the courage to take the leap no matter how much their heart pulls them they are simply fascinated by a lifestyle so outside the norm while social media the rise of digital nomading and websites like this have made quitting your job to travel the world or teach english in thailand a little more acceptable the general attitude is still follow the path if you want to be normal well i don t want to be normal i feel like the reason why people tell us we are running away is that they can t fathom the fact that we broke the mold and are living outside the norm to want to break all of society s conventions there simply must be something wrong with us maybe they are a little jealous too but life is what you make it out to be life is yours to create we are all chained down by the burdens we place upon ourselves whether they are bills errands or like me self imposed blogging deadlines if you really want something you have to go after it people who travel the world aren t running away from life just the opposite those that break the mold explore the world and live on their own terms are running toward true living in my opinion we have a degree of freedom a lot of people will never experience we get to be the captains of our ships but it is a freedom we chose to have we looked around and said i want something different and then we went for it it was that freedom and attitude i saw in travelers years ago in thailand that inspired me to do lead the life i am now i saw them break the mold and i thought to myself why not me i m not running away no i am just running towards my own idea of a normal life and i never plan to look back how to travel the world on a daymy new york times best selling book to travel will teach you how to master the art of travel so that you ll get off save money

planning checklists free guides and a ton of other money saving tips so you can plan your trip like a pro copyright nomadic matt s travel site i ve been traveling for close to twenty years in that time the airline industry has changed a lot the use of points and miles has become widespread round the world tickets have gone the way of the dodo airlines have consolidated and there has been an explosion of budget airlines over the last few years the cost of airline tickets has steadily risen they get more and more expensive while their prices often seem illogical since ticket pricing is an arcane and misunderstood subject i want to take some time to explain why your airplane ticket costs what it does ticket prices have increased over the decade for several reasons for starters the industry has consolidated a lot over the last few decades thanks to bankruptcies and mergers there are now only three major alliance airlines american delta and united in the united states and with the recent bankruptcy of spirit and the merger of alaska and hawaiian there s even less competition outside the big in canada there are only two major airlines westjet and air canada in europe air france klm british airways iag and lufthansa control the bulk of the market though thankfully in europe there are lots of budget airlines to choose from as airlines have partnered up merged or gone bankrupt there is little incentive to provide low fares to win your business after all when only one or two airlines are flying a route airlines know you don t have much choice less competition means higher prices secondly the price of airline fuel has increased tremendously back in jet fuel cost per gallon in it is per gallon airlines have simply passed that fivefold increase on to the consumer thirdly airline taxes and security fees have increased a lot adding to the cost of your ticket ever fly into london half the ticket price is made up of fees and taxes finally demand fell following the recession and to compensate airlines reduced both the number of routes they offered and the frequency of their flights fuller planes mean more passenger revenue and fewer costs for the airline that trend greatly accelerated during covid when covid shut down global travel airlines mothballed many of their older planes and laid off many of their staff when travel restrictions were lifted and more people started flying again they didn t have enough planes or staff to return to a pre covid schedule this decrease in the supply of flights coupled with the surge in demand for travel meant that airlines had little incentive to lower prices according to rick seaney of farecompare com before things were in favor of the passengers after the crisis the scale of justice tipped towards the airlines taken together a consolidated airline industry that is facing more costs is simply less likely to generally offer lower fares prices go up and down for many reasons there are four major factors that drive prices are competition supply demand and oil prices together those four things affect something called the load factor airlines want to fill their planes and maximize profits and they do this by calculating a plane s load factor essentially this is the percentage of seats sold on a flight they want this number to be as high as possible to get the highest possible load factor airlines will constantly change prices based on the four categories above in order to get people to buy tickets airlines use dynamic pricing models and artificial intelligence ai to figure out the maximum value they can get for each seat have you ever wondered why airlines seem to callously raise their prices after a big event spikes demand they aren t the ai is all it sees is sky high demand and adjusts accordingly to its programming more demand higher prices these advanced computer systems constantly compare booking trends to past sales history major events concerts sporting events weather and competitor behavior they can look at consumer searching and booking behavior and process lots and lots of data and change prices on the fly no pun intended in hopes of getting the best price possible all of this is why one day a flight may cost then the next and then back to the day after that as people buy seats on a flight airlines raise prices and when demand falls at a certain price point they lower prices until fewer and fewer seats are available then they will raise prices again it s a delicate balance designed to ensure maximum revenue it s why prices are cheapest for am flights more expensive over the holidays and through the roof during peak season or if there s a major sports event in town after all you can t add more seats to a plane so all they can do to raise revenue is charge higher fares it s also why prices might change in seconds it s not because they are tracking your cookies it s because the ai is responding to real time changes in seats think about it how many booking companies are out there lots all of them are reserving seats millions of people fly each day and with limited routes it s easier to fill planes so the ai doesn t need to discount fares as much as it had to in the past on a us domestic flight there might be different price points if the load factor is low and demand is low an airline will increase the availability of cheap fares if the load factor is high and demand is high the airline will raise prices as rick said the airline is advantaged now but it s not impossible to find a cheap ticket there are many many ways to find cheap airfare to avoid being the person who paid the most for their ticket the main thing to do is to be flexible airlines are constantly changing prices to increase revenue hoping to get people into the highest price buckets possible about three months before airlines start to manage those bottom price points rick says that means airlines begin to look at historical trends and current seat sales to figure out whether they will release those really rock bottom fares or keep prices high if you re booking inside a month you re playing into the airline s hands when your dates are no longer flexible you ll pay whatever they charge to find out how to navigate this system and get a cheap flight check out these articles i wrote the days of cheap airfares are long over they aren t coming back and the prices you see now are the new normal for airline tickets they are simply going to cost a lot more especially if you don t find the sweet spot when prices are their lowest but by understanding how tickets are priced you can avoid being the person who pays the most my new york times best selling book to travel will teach you how to master the art of travel so that you ll get

freedom to a road trip that you can t get with trains and don t get me wrong i love train travel too small towns beautiful parks historic buildings whatever you see you can stop for and can stay as little or as long as you d like over the years i ve been on dozens of road trips some destinations are just meant for them think new zealand ireland iceland the united states south africa etc etc however when you don t have your own car renting one can be a pain in the ass no one likes doing it and we all rightly worry we re getting ripped off there s always a lot of questions that go with renting a car where can i find the best deals how do i know this cheap car rental site is legit what are things i should watch out for and what about insurance do i really need that or is my credit card s insurance good enough in this post i am going to share my tips and advice to help you find a cheap but reliable car rental and how to avoid common pitfalls that many travelers make table of contentsstep join rental company mailing lists loyalty programsstep search for a car with discover carsstep check for discounts dealsstep check the sharing economystep book your car and book early questions to ask yourself before you rent a carhow to travel the world on a day table of contents most rental car companies advertise deals to their subscribers first as soon as you know that you re going on a road trip join the mailing lists of the major car rental company that way you can snag any deals on offer as soon as they are announced to find the main rental car companies in your destination simply visit the website of the airport you re arriving at and see what car rental companies are available there additionally like airlines many car rental companies have loyalty airlines that offer perks like discounts bonus upgrades and free rentals enterprise avis alamo and hertz are some of the major players on the market that offer free loyalty programs sign up for them so you don t miss out on any perks offers or upgrades while you can certainly check each car rental company individually for a deal the best way to compare prices is to use an aggregator these websites compile information from every car rental website so you don t have to spend time manually comparing prices before you book discover cars is the best car search aggregator to use as it pulls more cars from more websites to ensure you find the best deal it searches over websites for deals it cover countries and locations worldwide you can use the widget below to check prices and get a quote quickly and easily to compare rental car deals with discovercars comparison tool for cheap rentals be sure to compare weekly and daily rates as well for example if you need a car for days compare the price for a day trip as well sometimes it s cheaper to rent for a whole week and just return the vehicle early some car rental websites share discounts directly on their website for example b oth budget and avis have last minute deals sections on their website where you can find incredible discounts as long as you re flexible with your dates and destination most major car rental companies also offer discounts and deals to certain groups as well for example avis offers up to off to aarp members aarp is an interest group in the u s for people and over while budget offers up to off to veterans check and see if there are any discounts or deals you qualify for before you book such as corporate discounts government discounts senior discounts or discounts that stem from any hotel or airline programs you are a part of many travel credit cards also have perks or discounts for car rentals now that you ve found the best deal it s time to do a quick comparison with sharing economy websites like turo turo is like airbnb but for cars locals list their vehicle and a price per day and you can browse the options and book a vehicle it s not available everywhere they re currently only in the united states australia france the united kingdom and canada but you can find it in most major cities depending on your needs and the duration of your trip you might be able to find a cheaper deal renters need to be at least years old have a valid driver s license and have proof of a good auto insurance score you can either pick up the car have it dropped off or meet the owner somewhere to get the keys prices can be as low as usd per day making it an affordable option if you book early and if you re looking for an rv check out rvshare which is similar to turo but focused solely on rvs and campervans they have the largest inventory out there there s also the website imoova com where you relocate people s vehicles for them you ll be on a deadline as vehicles need to be delivered by a certain date however rates are usually just per day and many include some money for gas too book early like booking flights the closer you are to the date the more expensive the car will be assuming there are any left to rent the recent pandemic saw car rental prices skyrocket as people shifted from trips abroad to road trips at home the best time to rent a car is when you know you need to rent a car don t wait you can click here to get a quote directly from discovercars aggregator for global rental comparisons now that you ve found a cheap car rental here are some considerations to keep in mind before you book your rental are there driver requirements some countries charge extra if a driver is under years of age others require a certain amount of driving experience before one can rent a car usually one year each country has different requirements so make sure you read the fine print before you book you can learn more about getting an international driver s license on this blog post what does your travel insurance policy require car companies always push you to get extra insurance when you rent a car but should you that depends on whether you have your own travel insurance with collision coverage your own car insurance or coverage through your travel credit card some travel insurance companies and credit cards want you to decline the insurance from the rental agency while others insist you get it and make a claim with them first before you rent a car make sure you understand what is required by your existing travel insurance plan the credit cards listed here have really good car insurance coverage what is not included once you find a rental car companies usually try to sell you all kinds of extras gps liability insurance satellite radio a children s car seat these are just some of the extras not included in most rental cars find out what is and isn t included so you aren t surprised when picking up your vehicle do you need to fill the tank at the end some rental car companies allow you to drop off the car as is but that is really rare most insist you fill up the tank beforehand if you don t they charge you a highly inflated fee for the gas when they fill it up i always just fill the tank back up before i drop the car back off how can you avoid getting scammed before you head out on your trip take pictures and videos of the car specifically the bumper windshield and tires as these are the most likely areas to get damaged that way when you return it they can t blame you for any pre existing damage i always walk through with the person handing me the car and do a walk through with someone when i drop it off do you have unlimited mileage unlimited mileage is slowly becoming standard however it s not always the default check that you have unlimited mileage for longer road trips otherwise you ll be counting miles so you don t get billed extra do they charge for an extra driver if you re going on a road trip with friends or family chances are you ll be sharing the driving unless you re going with a spouse or domestic partner which some companies include as an additional driver for free that means you need to pay a fee for an extra driver usually usd per day limit your extra drivers if that s the case otherwise you ll be charged a fortune also keep in mind that it s illegal to charge fees for extra drivers in some places such as california where is the pickup drop off location most travelers pick up their rental cars at the airport while convenient airports charge companies fees for operating there fees that get passed onto the customer it s worth checking around to see if there s a difference in price for off airport locations if they are easy to reach chances are you can find a cheaper price there is the car automatic or manual transmission if you re from the us or canada and are used to driving an automatic vehicle you might be surprised when renting a car abroad as manual transmissions are standard in most other parts of the world because of this renting an automatic transmission car is usually more expensive double check that you re renting a vehicle that you can actually drive don t take chances trying to teach yourself on a rental car road trips are one of the best ways to explore a new destination and the freedom of having a car is unrivaled allowing you to get off the beaten path and into all kinds

so you can plan your trip like a pro copyright nomadic matt s travel site years ago the website earth porm reposted my article the ultimate guide to traveling when you re broke as i went through the comments on the post i was dismayed by the mean and dismissive comments people shared as well their misconceptions about travel these comments made me realize that despite all the detailed websites and books on how to make travel affordable and accessible too many people still believe the notion that travel is expensive unsafe and impossible unless you are rich too many say i can t it s impossible and become cynical about travel the notion that travel is expensive couldn t be further from the truth i wrote an entire book proving that very point yet people still have all kinds of misconceptions about budget travel and staying safe abroad so today i want to debunk of the most common travel myths i ve encountered over the years everything costs some money and that includes travel but the idea that travel is only about fancy tours beach side resorts and luxurious villas is outdated traditionally subtle marketing language made everyone believe that a fun vacation is an expensive vacation after decades of being bombarded by those insidious ad campaigns our collective consciousness still equates travel with luxury heck i used to believe this too but the fact of the matter is you don t need a trust fund or a high paying job to have an amazing trip you ll need to learn how to plan a trip you ll need to save money but you don t need to be rich to travel you just need to be creative and have the right priorities and it can even be done on minimum wage sure it may take longer to save for your trip and you may need to make sacrifices but if you want to travel whether for two weeks or two years you can find a way to make it happen here are some starting points that can help you lower your costs and travel on a budget collecting points and miles is the art of using travel credit cards to gain free travel by using your regular spending no extra purchases no jumping through loopholes just earning free travel by putting your date nights groceries gas and other regular expenses on a travel card i can t count the number of free flights and hotel stays i ve had over the years by collecting points and miles i ve been able to travel for a fraction of the price it would have cost otherwise opening up tons of possibilities for budget travel while applying for credit cards will cause a temporary dip in your credit score that dip gets corrected within two months if you keep paying off your bills unless you re looking to make a huge purchase like buying a house in the near future that minor dip will not affect you over time having more available credit will actually improve your credit score and i mean what s the point of building up a credit score if you don t use it you work to build a good credit score for the purpose of doing things with it i have over a dozen credit cards though i only actively use three and a credit score of out of as long as you pay your card off each month you don t need to worry here are some resources to help you get started couchsurfing is a sharing economy app that facilitates cultural exchange locals offer a free space in their home sometimes just a couch which travelers can use to then visit the city and learn about about the destination while staying in a stranger s house might not be for everyone it s nevertheless a safe and fun way to travel not to mention an affordable one much like airbnb couchsurfing hosts have reviews and profiles you can read to make sure you re staying with someone you feel you d get along with it s really not much different than airbnb except it s free of course if you re not ready to stay with a stranger you can also use to app to meet people for activities instead such as a meal coffee or a museum visit it s a great way to benefit from the app without having to stay with someone as long as you use common sense read reviews and trust your gut you ll be able to use the app safely while saving money and having fun there are families who host people solo female hosts who only host women as well as expats looking to connect with fellow foreigners couchsurfing and websites like it have vibrant communities because contrary to what the news and media like to report not everyone out there is a secret murderer looking for their next victim most people are good kind people just looking to make friends and learn new things don t let fear limit your opportunities hitchhiking is a relatively common way to travel in many countries around the world it was also a common and safe way to travel the us and canada for a long while too the idea that hitchhiking is dangerous dates back to the s when the fbi led a scare campaign to get people to stop the practice in part because civil rights activists were hitchhiking to rallies the fbi s campaign permanently embedded in the mind of people that hitchhiking is dangerous by claiming that most hitchhikers were murderers combined with a narrative pushed by the media that the world is unsafe hitchhiking continues to be perceived as a dangerous activity even if it s not my friend hitchhiked solo around the us kristin from be my travel muse hitchhiked around china i ve hitchhiked in europe the caribbean and central america and met wonderful interesting people in the process hitchhiking like couchsurfing is about using common sense make a note of license plates have a phone in case of an emergency and travel with a friend if you re not comfortable going solo and remember you don t have to get into any car that stops use your judgment and follow your instincts and you ll be able to meet lots of interesting people while still staying safe while both men and women face risks on the road women often encounter additional hazards that require caution and awareness but that doesn t mean women need to stay home or only go to super safe destinations the if it bleeds it leads approach to reporting over the years has highlighted only the negative stories of female travelers this style of reporting bolsters the perceptions that the world is so scary that solo female travel is very very unsafe and should be avoided fortunately that s not true at all you have a higher chance of getting hit by a bus than you do of ending up like in the movie taken but don t just take my word for it here s an excerpt from a post on women s safety if i look back on the times when people have told me don t go there or you might die it s mostly advice from people who have never been to those places and have never done any research on them the press is hugely influential i can t tell you how many times i ve read international press coverage that is flat out wrong you need to find trustworthy sources and advice from people who know what they re talking about i once mentioned to my parents that i had plans to go to rwanda my concerned father told me you re not going he was obviously worried about rwanda s tumultuous past had he done his research he would have known that rwanda is the safest country in east africa once he researched it i never heard another word about it the crime rates in your backyard can be just as bad as the destination you re headed to if not worse these days there are tons of powerful independent female creators traveling to all corners of the world including off the beaten path countries heck many of them are more adventurous than i am here are some to follow for inspiration too many people believe travel is something you can do only if you re young or single that couldn t be further from the truth i understand that when you are older you may want more luxury than a budget backpacker and i know that family travel requires more planning than solo travel b ut travel is not solely the purview of the young at the end of the day age doesn t matter i ve seen families and seniors backpacking around the world staying in hostels or driving rvs you don t need to be limited by age or your relationship status here are some articles that prove both families and seniors can travel on a budget we often think of working abroad as an challenging process not worth the effort it s something that requires interviews visas and a polished r sum but for the kind of jobs that you ll get as a traveler that s not true if you want to work and are flexible about what you re willing to do you can find employment almost anywhere you can get a working holiday in countries like australia or new zealand become an au pair teach english or even volunteer in exchange for room and board sure you might not get a fancy or well paying job but if your priority is travel then what does that matter farms schools bars restaurants cafes and the tourism industry are almost always looking for staff especially in areas with a seasonal influx of tourists you won t get rich but you will get to see the world if you want to learn more about your options here are some blog posts to get you started these travel myths come from years of being indoctrinated with the belief that travel has to be expensive and the world is scary that couldn t be further from the truth with a little research you ll discover that traveling the world is much safer and much more affordable than most people think how to travel the world on a daymy new york times best selling book to travel will teach you how to master the art of travel so that you ll get off save money

copyright nomadic matt s travel site i used to hate renting apartments from websites like airbnb or vrbo as a solo traveler i preferred the social atmosphere of hostels you met people hostels ran activities and they were where you were supposed to stay as a backpacker when i did want something other than a hostel i used a hospitality network liked couchsurfing or simply stayed with friends but after close to two decades as a nomad there are times when i like my privacy and the ability to create a home i like to cook want to relax on a couch and just chill while apartment rentals often contribute to overtourism discussed more below there are still plenty of real hosts out there who are renting places they live in below is a detailed guide about how they work how to pick the perfect apartment and how not to contribute to overtourism make locals upset table of contentshow do apartment rentals work how to pick the right apartmenta note on safetythe best sites to find a rental apartmenthow to travel the world on a day table of contents apartment rental sites allow locals to rent out an individual room shared space or entire home apartment the host lists their place online posts photos writes a description hits publish and presto they can start to make extra money with the unused space the booking process is like booking any other type of accommodation online you search the database find a place you like create an account and request a booking when the owner accepts you are sent a confirmation apartment rentals represent the space between hostels and hotels if you are traveling on business and want the comforts of home you probably aren t going to stay in a hostel but hotels may be too expensive or too impersonal for you a rented apartment is a perfect compromise traveling with friends or a big group this is definitely the option for you squeezing a bunch of people into a rental home apartment will be much cheaper per person than a room in a hostel or hotel plus you get space to spread out and relax dorm rooms and cramped hotels don t give you a lot of me time if you don t want a full apartment but are looking to save money airbnb has a new feature called rooms which lets you search for listings in people s homes or guest houses it s like how airbnb used to be people renting out extra rooms or guest houses for added cash you always get your own room and sometimes a private entrance you ll also get to interact with your host who can provide lots of insider tips and insight to your destination i ve used rooms a lot in the last couple of years in la rome paris nice and to me as a solo traveler it s a much better way to travel i highly recommend doing this as a way to combat the negative effects of these platforms more on that below additionally as hostels have gotten a lot more expensive over the years rooms are often cheaper than hostels you get to stay and meet with a local and save money win win unfortunately as accommodation rentals have exploded into the mainstream it s become harder and harder to find great hosts a lot of hosts now own multiple properties and live elsewhere that means you often deal with property managers and never get to interact with the actual owner additionally a lot of apartments aren t quite as nice in reality as they appear in the photos in order to find suitable accommodation i use the following criteria when looking for a place to stay on these platforms these rules are helpful guidelines but at the end of the day you have to go with your gut i don t need a listing to meet every point i once had a host who hit only a couple of these points and she turned out to be my favorite host and sometimes in places without many hosts you might have to be a little loose with this list but the more points a place meets the comfortable i feel renting how to avoid overtourism over the years airbnb and other apartment rental websites have dramatically raised the price of rents and pushed out the locals you want to interact with as people have started to buy multiple properties in order to rent them out to tourists it s a big problem in many places like lisbon and venice most locals can t afford the price of rent anymore and it s not just cities rural areas are now becoming affected too there have been strong protests against airbnb and similar sites in barcelona throughout europe you often see airbnb go home graffiti japan cracked down on airbnb nyc has strict laws against it now too residents in mexico city have protested every day brings a new story about the pushback against these websites given local pushback and the issues with over tourism and the housing market i strongly encourage you to only use airbnb or similar services if you are renting a room in someone s house especially in large cities in europe as i mentioned above airbnb has a new feature called rooms which allows you to easily search for rooms in people s houses where they actually live they are verified listings and a much better way to use the platform it s like how airbnb used to be before it grew so big people renting out extra rooms or guest houses for added cash i highly recommend it however if you can t try as hard as you can to make sure that the place you are renting is either a licensed b b if it s only used for tourists or someone s house that they actually live in this way you won t add to any local housing issues help end overtourism you have the power don t displace the people you want to visit these sites run on trust all these companies try to verify both buyer and seller to ensure no one ends up robbing anyone else but you sometimes hear reports of sex parties robberies or creepy hosts however apartment rental companies do provide a window that allows you to get your money back if you get a place that s not as advertised just call their hour hotline and they will set you up somewhere else you can also reach out on social media to get the conversation started they also hold your money in escrow so that if the place isn t as advertised you ll get your money back you never hand it over directly to the host all types of accommodations have risks cleaners can steal from hotel rooms dorm mates can take clothes from hostels couchsurfing hosts can get creepy which is why these rules are important i don t think apartment rentals are any less safe than your other options and the benefits greatly outweigh the perceived danger i think these are three best sites for finding an apartment another option for long term travelers is house sitting and pet sitting in exchange for looking after someone s property or pet while they travel you get access to free accommodation it s a great option for slow long term travelers looking to stay in one location for longer periods of time check out this post to learn more about it apartment rentals when done right are safe affordable and help you have a more authentic

years to come the last thing i want is an uncomfortable backpack for a long term trip or cheap electronics that are going to break shortly after the first use i learned the hard way that constantly replacing worn out gear ends up costing a lot more than investing in high quality equipment from the start get durable gear even if it costs a little more and you ll see that it saves money in the end here is a list of gear i use but keep in mind that not everything is suitable or necessary for every trip of type or traveler in particular i travel with a lot of electronics and photography equipment to keep this travel blog up to date use this guide to determine what you need at the very most and eliminate from it to create your packing list veken packing cubes are perfect for nearly every type of trip and really help to organize everything a durable bag and a gear backpack are key to protect and transport all of your items same with a toiletry bag just in case there s a mishap and things spill at least they re contained i never go anywhere without a reusable water bottle as they re ideal for filling up at the airport or wherever there is potable water available as travelers around the

list that we wanted to share with you all here are our top picks of must do adventures for your couples travel bucket list positano is the absolute epitome of a naturally beautiful cliff side city by the sea coupled with truly amazing people and some of the most delicious food one can find in all of italy rent a kayak by the hour from the main dock and spend your day exploring hidden beaches and enjoying the breathtaking coastal views castles included when you can rent a snorkel and mask on the beach for there is no reason not to take advantage of the crystal clear warm water that the gili islands has to offer gili meno in particular is known for having tons of sea turtles and beautiful fish no need to even rent a boat if you stay on gili meno you can simply walk out to the water in front of your hotel and make some new turtle friends amsterdam is one of the most beautiful cities we have ever been to take a romantic boat ride through the canals or even just enjoy the views from above the city is full of architecture unique culture and delicious food our favorite thing were the stroopwafels also if you both love good music and dancing attending amsterdam music festival and the amsterdam dance event are imperative kiss in the middle of the madness there s something special about how love can stop time walk into the middle of shibuya crossing in tokyo japan during a green light of course stop in the middle of the road and just stand there kissing for a minute you ll be surrounded by monotony but time will seem to stop for you and we found it incredibly romantic hike the picturesque plitvice lakes and swim in the natural waterfalls at krka national park be sure to get to both parks right when they open to enjoy the beauty without the crowds nice is home to a gorgeous coastline cute restaurants and a number of beautiful beaches take a walk along the boardwalk where you ll find a variety of water activities our favorite was parasailing the honeymoon island of greece santorini is covered with white buildings that are accented by a blue paint that mimics the natural blue beauty of the surrounding sea it s a stunning and iconic view hike the volcano just off the west coast of santorini with your loved one or grab an atv and explore the island s surreal views how could we not include our second home and the birthplace of the renaissance there are numerous cooking classes offered to the public in florence we suggest booking a class that is offered out of the chef s home having fun as a couple is absolutely imperative if you re stifled by stuffy dates and too much seriousness you ll always be left wanting more playing joking and having a great time together are all such important aspects of a relationship so what could be better than drinking beer eating pretzels and singing your hearts out to classic german drinking songs not to mention the new friends you ll make in the process bali s warm blue waters host some of the best surf breaks in the world most public beaches will offer very affordable board rentals and even lessons if you ve never surfed before there s nothing more fun than playing in the water or learning something new with

abroad popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips fashion food and photography from around the world follow kiersten on her adventures when it comes to european travel there are certain places that are easier for travelers to get around especially solo female travelers europe is a continent that is generally safe with low levels of crime reliable transportation and a respectful attitude towards women but naturally this can be felt more strongly in some places than others whether you are looking to go on a solo adventure or a trip with your girlfriends the spectacular scenery of iceland makes for an amazing destination to explore nature and when this is combined with a low crime rate friendly locals and developed tourist infrastructure it makes it a great place for female travelers a good range of day trips and attractions such as the blue lagoon the golden circle glacier hiking and diving at the silfra fissure means you can either join organized trips or do things on your own with great levels of equality clean and efficient transportation and amazing sights to see all of scandinavia is ideal for female travelers but sweden is among the best with stunning cities such as stockholm and gothenburg in the north of the country you can find stunning views of the northern lights or you can pay a visit to one of the many islands that make up sweden s archipelagos there are plenty of historic attractions to be found in portugal along with some amazing winelands and stunning beach destinations portuguese food is so delicious and the foodie scene walks such a fine line between tradition and innovation i love the wine culture too especially in cities like porto lisbon is also a top destination for those looking for some retail therapy as it is home to a great range of independent fashion designers italy is a beautiful country that has a balance of thriving culture and amazing cuisine along with a distinguished history unique culture and really stunning sights to see from exploring rome to wine tasting your way through florence eating pizza in naples walking the canals of venice and driving the beautiful amalfi coast female travelers will find no end to things to do in italy the country is welcoming and friendly and even more so when you start to discover the excellent local wine and food the mountainous country of switzerland in central europe has long been a popular tourist destination female travelers have their choice of adventures ranging from the cosmopolitan city of zurich the picturesque streets of geneva and the old town of bern plus what girl doesn t want to visit a country known for cheese and chocolate most people will naturally think of whiskey guinness and lots of greenery when thinking of ireland but i think of warm and charismatic locals beautiful winding roads stunning natural scenery and some whiskey and beer too there are no shortages of hidden gems around this country from the beautiful architecture and lively scene of dublin out to the rugged terrain on the wild atlantic way this is a great country to explore that is generally safe and friendly for female travelers i did a two week ireland road trip with girlfriends and it was an absolute blast if you are looking to travel on a budget croatia is generally cheaper than many european countries while still being a super friendly easy going and safe place to visit it s one of my all time favorite destinations the wonderful coastline means there are plenty of beautiful beaches and seafood rich cuisine along with great sailing and sunset cocktails come hungry and indulge in farm to table dishes plus local truffles honey wine and olive oil famous for the canals of amsterdam tulip fields windmills and a history of artists the netherlands has a population that is welcoming for all female travelers the flat terrain makes it great for outdoor sports such as cycling and hiking and there are epic sights steeped in a rich history and dutch culture throughout the country where stunning ruins volcanic cliffs and friendly locals meet the sparkling blue mediterranean sea my first trip to greece was a summer adventure through athens and mykonos i returned again to sail the saronic islands on the yacht week greece and then again to explore the cyclades islands of santorini milos and naxos the laid back culture is great for those who want to soak in some sunshine and ultra fresh food this charming country has a wealth of history throughout its cities and excellent transport connections sitting in the heart of western europe making it ideal to include as part of a longer european adventure brussels is home to some wonderful architecture the european parliament and the major edm festival tomorrowland while cities like ghent and bruges offer walks along romantic canals complete with white swans sightseeing aside belgium is also famous for its chocolate waffles frites and beer hi i m kiki a california

abroad all rights reserved the blonde abroad popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips fashion food and photography from around the world follow kiersten on her adventures from students to parents to busy professionals there are always reasons that people feel they can t make their globetrotting dreams come true and it usually is because of the price tag while travel does involve costs airfare accommodation and some activities there are many alternative ways to travel that not only save money but allow you to have new experiences and follow your wanderlust in fact depending on your destination you might even spend less seeing the world than you do staying in your own neck of the woods here are ways to spend less on travel that ll change everything in the summer most destinations are at their most expensive if it s possible to travel in the off season do it places like europe are perfect in the so called shoulder season april through mid june and september through october the weather is better places are less crowded and you ll save a lot of cash knowing how to find cheap plane tickets is an art at any time of year the number one strategy is to be patient finding a good price means you ll have to do some serious searching if you re debating the best way to travel check out the rome rio website it ll compare bus train air ferry and rideshare options so you can decide what makes the most sense for your trip keep in mind that sometimes combining transportation for example plane and train can often be the cheapest pick for ground travel look into multi way passes europe has some great deals that ll let you see the continent on the cheap look into interflix euro bus pass and the eurail pass for some bargains that will cure your wanderlust helpful tip if you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card i recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels plus many cards offer additional points when making travel related purchases some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card my personal favorite is the chase sapphire reserve for frequent travelers or the chase sapphire preferred if you re just starting out check out my favorite travel reward credit cards i love airbnb you ll typically find accommodation cheaper than a hotel and you can nab this airbnb discount from me it s even more budget friendly if you get a place where you can use the kitchen to cook in you can also check out homeexchange homestay com and vrbo for more great places where you can truly live like a local and explore amazing neighborhoods consider hostels as well and keep in mind that many do offer private rooms check out my post on the truth about staying in a hostel if you re debating whether the experience is right for you if you want to stay in a hotel look for ones that are located a little farther from the city center as they are usually cheaper taxis can tend to get expensive so i try to use uber whenever it s available metros are often the best way to travel and i recommend going underground for travel in almost any major city google maps has a public transit option that works in most cities just type in where you want to go and it will tell you exactly which lines and busses you need to take to get there a lot of big cities also have cheap and easy bike rentals that allow pick up and return around the city be sure to search for these bike share programs while you re abroad the way you organize your daily activities can make or break your budget some of my best memories have actually been on adventures that didn t cost a dime forget overpriced touristy restaurants the best way to try authentic grub is on a shoestring budget there s nothing like treating yourself to some retail therapy while you re away but there s definitely a right way and a not so cost effective way hi i m kiki

personal favorite travel stroller it s great for tall parents lies completely flat for napping on the go folds into a hand luggage compliant size and is sturdy while still being lightweight less expensive than most travel strollers high quality materials super durable handled weeks of cobblestone streets in europe like a champ built in newborn nest no add on bassinet needed adjustable tall handlebar for parents completely lie flat seat for naps not the lightest option at lbs is not a great option if you need to use it with an infant car seat you have to remove the entire stroller seat not a one hand open and close doona is the world s first complete and fully integrated travel system allowing you to move from car seat to stroller in seconds many of my friends swear by the doona and use it exclusively as their primary car seat and stroller all in one car seat and stroller design includes latch base for effortless use in your car lbs more lightweight than traveling with a separate car seat and stroller pricey rear facing only until the infant is lbs or inches so can only be used for infants until they ve outgrown it the yoyo is my favorite travel stroller if you want the lightest possible option and money isn t an object you can use it from newborn to toddler the yoyo stroller folds and unfolds in a moment can be worn over the shoulder and tucks in anywhere it folds to cabin bagage dimensions even with its newborn pack newborn to toddler design with add ons folds to cabin baggage dimensions includes padded strap and can be worn over the shoulder only lbs lbs with newborn pack can be used with car seats using an adapter pricey newborn set and accessories are sold separately non adjustable handlebar for someone who is always on the go it is super important for me to have something that is not only wireless but portable willow can go with you any time and you have the option to pump directly into a bag if you aren t using it right away you can also use a pourable bag which is ideal for preventing messy spills use code tba for off this convertible travel crib can be used as a crib or bassinet it folds up small enough to fit in a backpack and only weighs pounds making it perfect for travel this monitor is really cool because it is an all in one camera that has hassle free mounting it works with your phone as a monitor and has smart technology it will track a bunch of things like sleep temperature and humidity this has a travel adapter so you have the option to take it with you on the road this has been recommended to me time and time again i love that you can use it in the nursery or you can bring it with you wherever you re going it can even attach to a car seat you ll often see inexpensive mirrors for cars in registries which work but in terms of safety i prefer a camera so i don t have to look back i d much rather keep my eyes on the road and have a monitor showing the baby at all times it also has night vision so if you re driving in the dark you don t have to worry about not seeing your little one i love that it s portable and wireless so it s not just for the car there aren t a ton of ways to heat up a baby bottle on the go so i love that this is a cordless battery operated device it has adapters so it works with different types of bottles you can heat up a bottle on the plane or in the car and even adjust the temperature for formula or breast milk it s a really nifty gadget to keep in your diaper bag this travel bottle drying rack is small but enough space for lots of baby bottles nipples pacifiers and pump parts a portable uv sterilizer for pacifiers is a necessity in my mind it always freaks me out how often babies throw their pacifiers out of strollers and onto the ground this sanitizes in seconds it has a chargeable battery with over uses on a full charge it also comes on a key chain to keep it handy on your diaper bag one note is that you cannot use uv on natural rubber but it s fine for silicone pacifiers this all in one baby carrier is made to grow with your little one from week to months i love that it s has a lot of cute designs and fashion forward options if price is an issue another great option is the ergobaby omni this comfortable carrier is soft and wraps around without all the complexity clip at your waist put your arms through the straps tuck your little one in and you re good to go it s designed for month olds to two years of age use kiki for off the entire site i love how beis paired functionality with a stylish aesthetic we opted for the ultimate diaper pack as it s a bit bigger and more unisex and since meyer and i will both be wearing it it just made the most sense use code blondeabroad for off this lightweight and compact changing pad is ideal for diaper changes on the go made from cotton it s cozy yet water repellent keeping any messes manageable and easy to clean perfect for little ones and toddlers this blackout privacy pod allows your babe to get a good night s sleep anywhere day or night its bottomless design is made to fit over a travel crib mini crib or some toddler cots keep your little one safe from the sun this infant car seat cover makes it easy to protect babies from of uv it s also great for protecting from wind drizzle chill and bright lights this may just be the cutest suitcase ever elli ella s kid size luggage comes in a variety of colors they even have a floral print it can be wheeled to and from airport gates at the train station or around the house it has a retractable handle and a built in elastic band so your little one s favorite plush toy can come along for the ride this is the coolest this bundle includes travel essentials in one box a bedbox and the cutest backpack the bedbox essentially turns an economy seat into a first class seat so cozy and the crew backpack expands for travels big and small this is genius imagine a stress free flight with your little one the flyaway kids bed creates a comfortable place for them to sleep and play on planes it inflates in seconds and deflates in an instant it can be wiped clean and packs into a handy carry bag countless parent friends of mine have

travel tips fashion food and photography from around the world follow kiersten on her adventures every day i get questions about my travel gear and photography equipment for travel i want to disclose that i am not a professional photographer but i do love sharing my travel experiences through beautiful photos videos and vlogs over the years i ve tried a number of things improved upon my photography and editing skills and found some favorites along the way this camera is perfect if you re just starting to dip your toes into photography and plan to shoot mostly on auto settings i ve been using the fujifilm x t for years and loved how easy it made capturing beautiful shots especially while exploring on the go the new x t takes everything i loved about the x t and steps it up with a better sensor faster autofocus and an even more user friendly design it s still that gorgeous vintage inspired mirrorless camera that s lightweight compact and discreet if you re ready to start experimenting with manual settings the x t makes it super simple to adjust aperture shutter speed and other functions it also comes with an easy to use touchscreen and now features a brand new film simulation dial so you can play with fujifilm s iconic color profiles with just a twist more details on fujifilm x t i currently shoot with the fujifilm x t and absolutely love it it s been my go to travel camera for years but if you re looking for something even more powerful the x t is the next step up and packs some seriously impressive upgrades the biggest change the x t features a new mp sensor which means even sharper more detailed images without adding bulk it s actually lighter and more compact than the x t but still has that weather resistant body and the signature external dials that make fujifilm cameras so intuitive and fun to use while the x t has a vari angle screen that s great for video and vlogging one of my favourite features the x t brings back the way tilting screen which many photographers prefer for stills it also steps up with faster autofocus and better subject detection so whether you re photographing people animals or landscapes it s quick accurate and reliable if you re more focused on photography than video the x t is definitely worth considering it offers pro level performance in a compact body and is perfect for travel content creation and anyone ready to level up their camera game more details on fujifilm x t this is my favorite point and shoot camera for video inside its compact body the rx vii is packed with everything it takes to deliver gorgeous images the mm zoom lens is complemented by super fast af new real time tracking and real time eye af plus enhanced image stabilization and an external microphone jack for high quality movie shooting what makes it so awesome for vlogging is the preview screen s tilt option of degree up and degree down so you can always see your frame even when you re shooting yourself you can check

more details on the latest gopro hero if an slr camera isn t in the budget for your next trip snapping photos on your iphone is a great alternative for taking travel photos a smartphone is not only good for taking photos and editing apps but also as a wifi remote for your camera more details on apple unlocked iphone this mm lens is a small standard zoom and the first lens i got for my fujifilm x series camera in my opinion it is the most versatile and affordable kit lens in the fujifilm x series and great for day to day shooting it s one of the most compact zoom lenses i ve seen making it perfect for travel in recent years the fujinon mm f lens has become my new go to over the mm for a few reasons it has almost the same focal range as the but has an extra mm mm allowing for a slight wide angle view it captures just a bit more of the scene when fully zoomed out ever wanted to get an epic shot but all the elements wouldn t fit in the photo you ll need a wide angle for that having a wide angle lens is awesome for landscape shots or shooting indoors in tight spaces i typically use it when i want to shoot a large building or monument or give something scale if there s not a lot of room to capture the entire scene i ll always switch to this lens there are two mm lenses in the x series lineup i prefer this model for its f aperture it is most useful for shooting images with a closer subject and shallow depth of field and while working in low light conditions print instax photos by sending images from your smartphones to the small portable printer by using the free instax share app this bag fits your camera a lens and a few small personal items remove the strap and the bag functions as a protective camera organizer inside of a larger bag the perfect tripod for stable

great escape maybe you should just stop thinking about it and put some plans into action for anyone thinking ya right i can t afford to travel this article is for you the reason you might think time away is going to cost a fortune is because hotels car rentals and activities come with a price tag but there are many alternative ways to travel that not only save money but allow you to engage with local communities and people in ways that will absolutely immerse you in a whole new culture and outlook on life plane tickets cost money sure but adventure and spirit filled happiness is priceless the following programs and websites offer some totally awesome ways to help lower your expenses and essentially travel the world for free websites like work away list hosts in all different countries around the world that let you stay with them in exchange for a few hours volunteering throughout the week okay you pay a signup fee for this website but it s like euros considering you d struggle to get a hostel for a night for that price and here you get access to all these hosts for two years it s a no brainer one of the better known free methods of travel is couch surfing where you can host or stay with people around the world people likely to host you couch surfing are travelers themselves who know what it s like to be on the road some people may be worried about their safety when staying with a stranger but use your best judgement and have some trust in fellow humans put on your responsible hat and take care of someone s house pets and gardens while they re away websites like homeexchange and mind my house help play matchmaker for homeowners and home watchers around the world again there s a small annual fee but for long term sitting you d be paying pennies per day to live in an amazing property hello month long accommodation while this is something that mostly benefits american travelers credit card rewards programs offer benefits for everything from free fine dining to free hotel stays to free international flights while it can take some serious research and a bit of a mastery of rewards programs travel hacking can help you use rewards points wisely and ultimately travel for free helpful tip if you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card i recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels plus many cards offer additional points when making travel related purchases some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card my personal favorite is the chase sapphire reserve for frequent travelers or the chase sapphire preferred if you re just starting out check out my favorite travel reward credit cards wwoof stands for world wide opportunities on organic farms where travelers can live and work on a farm in exchange for free meals and accommodation it s a great opportunity learn about a local culture learn something new and get outdoors simply pick a destination and see what opportunities are available same as with couch surfing it s time to trust in mankind western european countries like france and spain have a

screams that s mine when it comes to carry ons it s essential to have the right size bag for travel within the united states you can usually take a inch tall carry on bag when you are outside of the united states generally you will be restricted to a inch carry on since your space is restricted you ll want to find a bag that s easy to organize and maximizes every inch this smooth rolling bag with a trolley handle that s cushioned yes a beautiful feature in my opinion ensures that your hands won t ever feel the stress of towing luggage it has a built in weight indicator so if it s over the

abroad popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips fashion food and photography from around the world follow kiersten on her adventures there is nothing that soothes me and leaves me feeling more revitalized than exploring the world while detoxing from social media and journaling are smart ways to better connect with yourself my favorite form of self care is travel as we enter into the new decade i m sure you are with me in looking for ways to feel better and brighter to make this your best year i encourage you to go out and explore traveling is one of the most enlightening and fun forms of self care while solo travel isn t everyone s cup of tea whatever opens up your mind and pushes your boundaries is just what the doctor ordered whether that means traveling with a friend a significant other or going alone travel has so many psychological and emotional benefits travel opens your eyes it changes the way that you see the world as well as the way that you look at yourself the world is such a diverse and magical place exploring far flung destinations allows you to see and experience other cultures for me relating with people in different circumstances across the globe has made me more empathetic by giving me a better sense of what it s like to live in someone else s shoes seeing the world through someone else s eyes and understanding what is important to them puts things in perspective many times it has pushed me to reflect on my own problems and realize that they aren t as insurmountable as they might feel it is all too easy to live in a bubble and traveling is sometimes just what you need to appreciate the things that you may take for granted back at home i have learned so much through the people that i ve met around the world staying in hostels hanging out in restaurants and cafes and simply getting around on local transport are fantastic ways to meet other people open your mind to meeting all kinds of people ask about their lives hear what they have to say where they re from and why they re traveling you can learn more than you might think before you go here are a few tips that ll make it easier to meet people as you travel travel physically pushes you to get out of your comfort zone and break from routine looking to shake things up and really see how you can grow hop on a plane and explore new terrain when you re having to navigate a foreign country or communicate in a place that doesn t speak your mother tongue you really open yourself up to learning experiences and just seeing how much you are capable of that place up there that s mt huashan in xi an china the world s most dangerous trail while you don t have to do that hike to get out of your comfort zone the moment that you pack your bags things start to change everything is new and often things don t go according to plan sure it can be very challenging at times and maybe downright frustrating with language barriers but in the end you learn so much about others and yourself let this new self awareness propel you to explore your goals and figure out what direction you want to head next both literally and metaphorically first time abroad here is everything you need to know before your first trip overseas the constant buzz and glow of your phone can be draining put your phone on silent and maybe even turn it over to airplane mode sometimes so that you aren t always distracted while taking pictures is a must when you are visiting somewhere new i prefer to share my snapshots after the trip staying off social media allows me to truly embrace the present moment the constant buzz and glow of your phone can be draining put your phone on silent and maybe even turn it over to airplane mode sometimes so that you aren t always distracted while taking pictures is a must when you are visiting somewhere new i prefer to share my snapshots after the trip staying off social media allows me to truly embrace the present moment travel is the best way to escape your bubble it s easy to get caught up in the little problems of our daily lives but once you take a step back you realize how small or insignificant those problems are in the grand scheme of themes you get a break from fomo and small town drama the world is so much bigger than your neighborhood when i get back from a trip i find myself appreciating the little things in life my bed feels just a bit cozier and simple conveniences are just a dream for instance did you know that tampons are impossible to find in some places around the globe check out my post on traveling with aunt flo for more info getting into a rut is all too easy we all go into autopilot sometimes you know how it is you go to and from work sit in front of a screen at night and then the days start to blur together if you are feeling burnt out now is the time to book a ticket and switch things up my personal form of self care is specifically solo travel going it on your own means that you are literally spending all that time by yourself when you are exploring on your own you are the maker of decisions and the problem solver whatever obstacles and hurdles come up you have to navigate them by yourself but it s not all hard work it s also a chance to completely indulge yourself while it s fantastic to be surrounded by people you love maybe your friends don t necessarily want to see the same movie you do go to a new art museum or try a certain restaurant solo travel makes you realize you can do everything you want to do i dare you to take yourself on a date never underestimate the psychological and emotional benefits of giving yourself me time along with a much needed digital detox considering solo travel but feeling intimidated here are a few places that i found very welcoming to women traveling alone travel can be the best form of self care it can heal a broken heart it can help you reignite your passion it can help you grow and become a more understanding person how has

about what you can achieve and the type of results you can expect for those who do their research and plan for something that suits them as well as the organization they will be volunteering with then it can be a wonderful and life enhancing experience that is great for everyone involved global water brigades in honduras although the idea of volunteering seems like a wholly good thing that will have a positive impact it is important to research that the work you will be doing is ethical unfortunately it s become all too common that some organizations and non profits bringing in western ideas and volunteers to developing countries cause more hard than good one of the hardest things for new eager volunteers to understand is that not all organizations even non profits are doing good necessary work that ethically develops the communities and eco systems where we volunteer our time for that reason take a step back from the planning and instead learn more about core problems facing development projects when they bring in western volunteers and ideas shannon o donnell a little adrift the best projects are those that receive support from the local population an organization should be working with the local community as opposed to trying to change things against their will consider how your volunteer work will support the area in which you are working and the kind of impact you volunteering there may have both the direct impact and the indirect implications of you working in that area epic arts center for disabled youth in cambodia one of the challenges that people taking a volunteer travel trip may encounter is that the work itself may be quite different to what they were expecting while many people think that volunteer travel can involve something quite exciting such as diving to tag beautiful sea creatures with gps trackers the majority of volunteer projects will usually involve a lot of hard work if you have never volunteered before then it is usually worth starting to volunteer with a local project in your community before committing to international volunteer roles just to be sure that it will be the right thing for you there are countless types of volunteer opportunities so identify what it is you would be most interested in it is also important to look at the skills that you have to offer a volunteer organization whether you speak another language have medical experience or have a particular talent for construction then think about how those skills can be applied in a volunteer role volunteering with biblioworks in morado k asa bolivia picking the right organization that offers the right volunteer opportunity for you can often be a difficult choice as not all organizations will offer the same support and the same experience it s important to be aware that there are situations in which some volunteer organizations are not always run purely for charitable reasons if you are fundraising or have to pay for a fee for your volunteer opportunity then it is important to know where the money is going and that the money ends up in the right place it is also important to know how much total contribution you are expected to make both in terms of the time you need to dedicate to the project and the money you will need to either raise or pay to the organization as you are considering these aspects it is also worth considering how much time you are willing to commit to your volunteering opportunity do you want to work hour days six days a week for the organization or are you looking for a more balanced experience taking up a few hours three or four times a week the vital part of choosing the right volunteering experience is to do your research make sure you are aware of the commitment you are making and to see what others have said about the same volunteering work give surf in bocas del toro panama one of the realities of being a volunteer is that all charities and organizations need funding they will most likely ask you to either fundraise a certain amount before agreeing to your volunteer placement or they will ask you to raise money while you are volunteering this is because providing volunteers with accommodation food tools health and safety equipment and everything else they need to do their work does cost money if you are being asked to raise money or make a contribution before starting your volunteer placement asking the organization about what this money will be used for is important when it comes to fundraising there are a variety of different platforms that can be helpful for receiving donations and keeping track of money raised but many charge fees of to cover their expenses the best and lowest cost online fundraising platform that i ve found is you caring which has fees the only fees are from paypal typically when donations are made by credit card or debit card once you have started work as a volunteer keeping in touch with your donors is also a great way to let them know how their support has helped you to make a big difference for your chosen cause depending on your skills the type of experience you are looking for and your own interests there are a variety of different volunteering opportunities available as you travel keep in mind volunteering isn t just about traveling abroad or getting your hands dirty either many non profit organizations need administrative fundraising marketing and legal help more than anything which people can volunteer their time from remotely for those looking to volunteer their time and energy abroad here are some examples of volunteer roles to explore if you would like to travel but don t have a lot of time to be able to offer or are looking for a fun and rewarding experience then volunteering for a particular event can be very exciting volunteering your time as staff for events such as charity concerts and charity fun runs can all help these organizations to raise money there are also opportunities to volunteer at big sporting events in i was a team usa volunteer for the paralympic games in london it was a fun rewarding and unforgettable experience for those who have a

peruvian promise the money we raised helped pay for three girls college educations literacy is one of the greatest tools we can give to people so that they can help themselves working in developing countries is one of the most common types of volunteer travel and this can be for both skilled and unskilled volunteering those with medical qualifications such as dentists doctors and nurses are particularly valued and can either help with general programs or can be sent in as aid with organizations like red cross for medical emergencies like hurricanes and earthquakes one of the biggest global issues is access to clean water and is something i highly consider supporting as your first international volunteer experience organizations like global water brigades where i volunteered in honduras help improve water quality and bring clean water access to developing parts of the world these are often very desirable volunteering opportunities and these can include working with injured or endangered animals such as at an elephant or lion sanctuary there are also many projects that work to support the habitats of these animals although it is particularly important to research the ethics of the organization you will be volunteering with before committing to the volunteer work nurtured by nature otters animal non profit in california there are several things to consider before you make the commitment to volunteer especially if you intend to volunteer on a longer term basis if you are looking to be able to travel along with volunteering make sure you choose a volunteering project that allows you the free time to do this many projects will expect you to be able to volunteer for similar hours to that of an employee working a normal week it is also worth checking to see if the organization does insist on particularly long days or periods of extended work during your project you should also find out what the accommodation arrangements will be as some projects will offer hostel style accommodation with food included and others can be very basic knowing what to expect ahead of time will help ensure that you aren t uncomfortable with the experience once the volunteer program begins it is also important to be realistic in terms of what your work can achieve as most projects will not see dramatic changes during a two week or even a month long volunteer stay many projects take several years to show their impact peruvian hearts in cusco peru if you have read this guide and are thinking about taking a trip that allows you to volunteer abroad i ve

adventures while wearing sunscreen is extremely important to protect your skin did you know that it can cause damage to our planet s reefs when sunscreen washes off of your skin and mixes with the water it can contribute to coral bleaching and even speed up the process while many people aren t familiar with coral bleaching you ve probably heard something along the lines of well it s not just the great barrier reef but coral reefs around the world places like hawaii seychelles and the maldives are impacted by the chemicals in some sunscreens not only do the chemicals hurt the reefs but they can also be toxic for marine life the culprits research has now found quite a few including oxybenzone octinoxate homosalate octocrylene avobenzon octisalate and parabens in response countries and regions are stepping up reef harming sunscreen ingredients have now been banned or restricted in places like hawaii palau aruba thailand within marine parks and mexico because of the harm they can cause many islanders are taking matters into their own hands and developing reef safe sunscreens in hopes of protecting their home want to make your environmental impact on the world less from tips to how to make your life more green at home to sustainable practices and eco friendly travel resources here is the sustainability and eco travel guide we can all do something to reduce our carbon footprint while traveling here are my tips on how to reduce your environmental impact while climate change is one of the biggest factors impacting marine life the sunscreen we use doesn t have to add to that so what exactly is coral bleaching when the chemicals in sunscreen get into the water they can cause damage to the dna in larval and adult stage coral but what does that mean it limits their growth and ability to develop in a healthy way essentially coral can t reproduce as it should yet some studies suggest that oxybenzone can make coral more vulnerable to bleaching at lower temperatures than usual and with oceans heating up this is huge think about when you get a fever it s only a few degrees higher than your normal body temp but man oh man can you feel it yet some studies suggest that oxybenzone can make coral more vulnerable to bleaching at lower temperatures than usual and with oceans heating up this is huge think about when you get a fever it s only a few degrees higher than your normal body temp but man oh man can you feel it as coral reefs are already struggling we don t want to add anything else that might harm them your skin is your biggest organ so you should be doing everything you can to help protect it right think about what happens when you use sunscreen you reapply multiple times and allow it to soak into your skin if you re using a spray you potentially inhale sunscreen fumes or if you apply spf to your lips you could ingest a small amount the fda is concerned that some sunscreens might include cancer causing ingredients be messing with hormones and causing endocrine disruption no thank you sunscreens that also contain retinyl palmitate aka vitamin a which is an antioxidant that combats skin aging may actually trigger the development of skin tumors when in the sun the fda is concerned that some sunscreens might include cancer causing ingredients be messing with hormones and causing endocrine disruption no thank you sunscreens that also contain retinyl palmitate aka vitamin a which is an antioxidant that combats skin aging may actually trigger the development of skin tumors when in the sun don t worry that doesn t mean you need to stop wearing sunscreen not at all first when looking to purchase a new sunscreen lip products and skin lotions steer clear of ingredients like vitamin a aka retinyl palmitate retinyl acetate retinyl linoleate and retinol second avoid spray sunscreen when you spray the sunscreen you re not only getting it on youreslf but you re also getting it all over your surroundings you re putting solutions into the air and all over the sand potentially causing harm to even more critters and their habitats and last but not least wear mineral sunscreens they are typically made with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide research shows that few if any zinc or titanium particles actually penetrate the skin so when it comes to sunscreens mineral ones tend to be better than chemical for both you and the environment if using spray sunscreen is absolutely necessary i recommend spraying yourself in the shower or spray into your hand to apply this way you can contain it in an enclosed space these are some of my favorite reef friendly water resistant and biodegradable sunscreens reef safe oxybenzone octinoxate free tested and proven reef safe biodegradable everyday sunscreen researching the ingredients in your sunscreen will not only help the environment but it will also help you live your best healthy life so take a peek at those ingredients and check out if the sunscreen you re purchasing is reef friendly especially for your next tropical vacation if you want to ensure your lifestyle is more eco friendly when you travel i ve compiled a guide on all the things you can start

and get exclusive travel tips giveaways and more copyright the blonde abroad all rights reserved the blonde abroad popular travel and lifestyle blog featuring travel tips fashion food and photography from around the world follow kiersten on her adventures as female travelers it s important to look at the complexities of safety and what it really means to be safe we often talk about safe solo travel destinations where the best places are to go as a gal and what places are ideal to explore alone but things can get tricky once you are actually there it is critical to understand that safety is not the same as comfort just because a place is safe doesn t mean you won t encounter different cultural norms that make you uncomfortable it also doesn t mean that crime doesn t happen these ideas often get misconstrued and while getting out of your comfort zone can be a really good thing it can also be uncomfortable too often i hear people talk about letting their guard down because they ve heard a destination is safe and then they are frustrated when they realize that things can still go wrong especially when they encounter cultural norms much different from their own the truth of the matter is you can be unsafe anywhere at any time but this doesn t mean you should stop traveling or avoid going solo as a woman what it does mean is that we need to come together for an open and honest conversation about travel safety what does it mean to feel safe does it mean that you re comfortable in your environment does it mean you re not getting cat called or harassed does it mean you don t feel like you have to be on alert does it mean the city or country has a low violent crime rate safety can be defined in so many different ways and your own cultural norms are going to play a major role in that when you re traveling somewhere new it s essential to be prepared to get outside of your comfort zone no matter how safe you ve heard it is the farther you are from home the more likely you are to run into surprises lingering looks or being approached on the street can definitely be unsettling while being talked to in a certain way might make you uncomfortable one thing to note is that when you re traveling abroad oftentimes there are serious differences in cultural customs and those have the potential to lead us to feel unsafe identify what makes you feel unsafe so you can properly assess the threat level could it be culture shock or are you actually in a bad situation that you want to avoid one of my main goals with the blonde abroad is to give everyone insight and access to my personal travels helping you plan your trip ahead of time and giving you the tools necessary to aid you in your adventure recently i ve been noticing some conversations online where individuals felt they got a false impression of a destination being safe through social media because they experienced catcalling and harassment by local men again this brings to the conversation of what is safe and what is uncomfortable the big takeaway is that you are never guaranteed the same experience as someone else what feels safe to me might feel a bit dodgy to you we have to take accountability for our own safety and experiences so it s important to seek advice from trusted resources and to also always stay vigilant regardless of how safe you hear a destination is i wanted to share a story about how i gained my personal perspective on travel safety iceland is ranked as the safest country in the world by the global peace index with political stability and a relatively low crime rate it s an ideal solo travel destination for all types of travelers because iceland feels so safe my mindset was very laid back and i got lazy with taking notice of my surroundings we were camping and i went in to use the public showers believing and feeling how safe it was i unfortunately left my valuables phone and camera on top of my towel just outside the shower stall guess what easy target it could have been a hardened criminal preying on tourists or it could ve been a teenager who was taking advantage of an easy situation while it obviously sucks i would still consider iceland an amazing and safe destination to travel to however it s the only time i ve ever been the victim of a crime in all of my travels the fact is crime happens everywhere in the world and you become an easier target if you make it easy to reverse the example i ve been living in south africa for nearly years i ve never had so many people shocked and bothered that i was living in such an unsafe destination and i get it to give perspective iceland is ranked on the gpi while south africa is ranked almost at the bottom pretty much every one of my friends from here has experienced some form of petty crime in their lifetimes i ve learned through my travels that where there is desperation people will do desperate things and there is a lot of poverty in the country knowing that my body language my mindset and my overall vigilance are different to when i travel to places like iceland i lock my car doors as soon as i get in i check my uber driver s license plate number before getting in i don t walk alone at night i keep my purse on my lap when i dine out i read my surroundings and people s energy and steer clear of anything that seems off for me these are not experience altering measures just a normal way of operating here i still think south africa is safe to explore you just should stay alert check out this article on safety in south africa from a local s perspective based on my own experiences i would argue that we should have the same heightened awareness no matter where we are traveling and no matter how palpable the safety is especially when traveling solo dressing in a culturally appropriate way is both respectful and a key element of avoiding unwanted attention when i traveled to morocco with a girlfriend i found the catcalling and unwanted attention quite overwhelming but dressing very conservatively and wearing a scarf over my hair helped to divert some of those lingering eyes while changing the way i dressed didn t and won t completely negate that attention it will help you to blend in more i ve shared before on what to pack for a trip to a conservative country but it s always a good reminder to take a look at dressing to blend in goes a long way like it or not many conservative countries have not so great stereotypes about western women and showing skin even when it s scorching hot won t do you any favors use my packing ideas below but revise as needed based on weather and season for when you plan your own trip to a conservative country like morocco jordan turkey uae indonesia and more when someone is making you uncomfortable it is crucial to keep in mind that it doesn t always come from a place of malice during my first trip to china i traveled to a more remote area of the country and was in total shock at how many people wanted to take my picture it can make you feel uneasy to be constantly stared at but some people there had never seen a person who is not of chinese ancestry so i might have seemed unusual and different similarly as a solo female in morocco i felt like i was constantly being pestered but at the same time i never felt physically unsafe no matter what i always mentally prepare myself before traveling to middle eastern islamic countries i think that western women might feel a bit intimidated before traveling to these places based on media and the representation of this part of the world i personally have had such lovely experiences with locals but there are key cultural differences and i know that as a woman in these countries i might not be treated with the same regard and respect that i would expect back home women and men share different roles in different parts of the world that can be as simple as a man refusing to speak directly to you and have to talk with you through another man and while that s a matter of a cultural difference it might feel disrespectful to you as a western woman that is frustrating to me but i have to realize it s a cultural difference and not a matter of safety so while women might not be viewed as second class citizens it may feel like that for others that are used to a different culture it really comes down to men and women play very different roles if you know what to expect before you go it s not so scary and you can better gauge what is alarming versus normal behavior you can also get destination specific advice on how to manage and mitigate these situations i am a firm believer that solo travel is one of the best experiences anyone can ever have it does however come with extra responsibility when you travel with a male partner a girlfriend or in a group you have a buffer around you from the outside world when you are on your own people are much more likely to approach you and if you re not used to this i can definitely understand how the attention would feel overwhelming before you set off on your first solo trip be sure to read about the ten most common mistakes made by solo female travelers no matter where you are it is crucial to stay alert this doesn t mean being scared all the time it means being smart whether you are in england or bali there are certain precautions you should always take first of all you should let someone know where you are at all times this can include hotel hostel staff when i am solo i often check in with them to share my plans it s also helpful to talk to locals about different neighborhoods familiarize yourself with places to avoid and know your route avoid dark alleys and anywhere else that makes you feel uneasy before you go give some thought to what you re carrying avoid flashy jewelry and other expensive items keep valuables tucked away as in a camera in your bag as much as possible before you walk out the door always have your phone charged and bring a battery bank if possible i d also advise picking up a local sim card wherever you are so you don t always have to find places with wifi to check in or get directions i travel with a mobile wifi hotspot device for work purposes but also for safety if you re nervous about visiting a destination the first thing i would suggest is research research research egypt occupied a top spot on my bucket list for ages however i had been hesitant to travel there because of stories i d heard of women having negative experiences there while i wholeheartedly believe that other people s travel experiences don t predict your own it did give me an insight into what i might experience i ended up having a wonderful time exploring egypt and met so many friendly locals a total stranger literally handed me her baby but i do know it can be nerve wracking when you re thinking about traveling to a place that doesn t always get the best reputation for solo travel like jordan or egypt while i traveled to egypt solo i decided to hire a guide for that particular trip so that i had a local with me during the day and could prevent any unwanted attention and guess what i loved it i still got to do what i wanted to do when i wanted to do it but i did what i felt would enhance my experience and make me feel comfortable so if you want to travel to somewhere but going solo isn t the route you want to take no worries there are tons of options like joining a group tour you could hire a private tour guide or you could stay at a high rated hostel that offers tours and group activities if it s your first time traveling solo this post is not meant to scare you but just to make you aware and be a smart traveler i think being prepared doing your research and having realistic expectations are the best things you can do for yourself when heading out on any excursion whether it s solo or not i d suggest checking out these posts to prepare yourself while harassment can happen anywhere no matter what

mean stop traveling and that doesn t mean you should live in fear you will meet good people along the way you will encounter different things and you will have experiences that shape you it s just better to be prepared and to not gloss over the not so nice things that happen so ladies let s share tips and stories i am eager to open up the discussion below and hopefully we can all gain some

love to share with you the actual destination of your trip can play a big factor in cost so i ve compiled a list of budget friendly travel destinations around the world travel can make you thirsty whether you re hopping on a redeye or wandering around a new city you ll probably find yourself spending too much on beverages a glass of wine here an overpriced latte there and two more water bottles than you actually need is it a party night enjoy a beer with friends in your room or the hostel lounge before you head out for a night of drinking or dancing while you re out try some local beer or liquor these are usually cheaper than imports like heineken or budweiser in many countries coffee is an overpriced luxury avoid chains like starbucks and dunkin donuts and try a local barista sometimes they ll even have a local flavor oat milk in iceland anyone order a regular coffee and you ll often get a refill unlike with those expensive cappuccinos and lattes you have to order one by one money is no excuse not to travel through my adventures i have gathered some budget busters here are six ways to spend less on travel europe is a great region to explore on a budget here is a breakdown of typical expenses so you know how much to budget for backpacking europe a one of a kind souvenir is like a memory you can hold and take back home with you checking out the markets for something fun and memorable is a great way to interact with locals practice your threadbare language skills and do some shopping you can often end up with much more than you bargained for and more

backpacking south america using your phone abroad if not properly set up can cost you a pretty penny as long as you have wireless connection you can use anyone s wifi abroad mobile data is another story make sure you speak with your service provider about international options it can sometimes switch on international data at a low cost for a limited time i ve been traveling with a solis wifi hotspot and i couldn t go back you literally just turn on your hotspot and it ll automatically connect to the local network just check the coverage map before you go to make sure you will be covered and you re set you don t need to register or even know which local networks you are using from figuring out what kind of trip you re after to who pays for what to ways to stretch your dollars here s how to budget for a trip when traveling as a couple you ll want to check with your bank for any potential international atm fees or direct card charges that may apply during travel before you embark many banks charge a percentage for each transaction and often more for atm withdrawals while you re logged in to your bank s portal provide the names of the countries on your itinerary failing to alert your bank of travel may cause your cards to be blocked and that would be a bad start to a vacation so you ve got your flight booked now what there are lots of planning steps to take before your next trip to make it a breeze here are things you should never forget before a trip more and more airlines are charging by the item for the seat for food for extra bags save yourself stress and hassle by arranging all of it online prior to your trip before your flight log in to your itinerary on the airline s website with your confirmation code and pre purchase any extra items or services need an aisle seat in economy plus seating buy it online carrying more bags than the allotted one or two buy it online airlines will often charge you extra if you make any of these arrangements at the airport on your day of departure if you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card i recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels plus many cards offer additional points when making travel related purchases some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card my personal favorite is the chase sapphire reserve for frequent travelers or the chase sapphire preferred if you re just starting out check out my favorite travel reward credit cards want to fly around the world
